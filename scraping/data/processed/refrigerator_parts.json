    "content": "The overload relay is a protection device used in the compressor circuit on your refrigerator. Power is applied to the compressor motor windings through the overload device, and the relay is used to add the start winding in the circuit until the compressor is at running speed. If the fans are running and your compressor won’t start or if you hear a clicking sound from the unit, check the overload relay for signs of overheating or arcing.\nHow to test a refrigerator’s overload or relay-start capacitor with a multi-meter:\n\nBegin by ensuring you have unplugged your refrigerator, and then remove the rear panel.\nLocate and remove your overload or relay-start capacitor. On modern refrigerators the overload relay is usually a combined part and plugs directly onto the side of the compressor. There may also be a start capacitor attached to the relay overload assembly, which provides increased starting voltage to the compressor windings.\nTo test, begin by discharging the capacitor, then set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and place the probes onto the terminals of the overload capacitor and/or the relay-start capacitor. The reading you should receive will vary from model to model, and may be indicated on the outside of the capacitor, or in your owner’s manual.\nIf your test does not produce the reading the manufacturer recommends, you need a replacement overload or relay-start capacitor. If your tests do produce the recommended readings you may have a defective compressor, which will need to be tested by a qualified professional as it is a live circuit test.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Refrigerator Parts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\nBack to Top",

Most manufacturers recommend replacing the filter every 6 months, but local water conditions may require that you replace more frequently.\nHow to inspect your refrigerator’s ice and water filter:\n\nConsider when you last changed your ice and water filter. How frequently you need to change your filter varies by model and local water conditions, but you should never exceed 12 months of use per filter.\nFind and remove your water filter. The exact location differs from model to model, but it is commonly located in the water line leading to the fridge, behind the base grill, or inside the unit attached to the rear corner or ceiling. If your filter is in the water line, you will need to disconnect the water supply before beginning.\nWith the variety of locations and removal instructions, we recommend you follow brand specific directions, or refer to your owner’s manual for specific directions. Take note of the installation date on your calendar before installing the new filter.\nIf your filter is damaged or clogged, or if you have exceeded the manufacturers’ recommended guidelines, you will need a replacement ice and water filter.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Refrigerator Filters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\n\n\n\nHow to remove and replace a water filter\n\nBack to Top",

    "content": "The defrost termination thermostat is used as a safety device to turn off the defrost heater when the temperature reaches a specific limit. The thermostat is normally wired in series with the defrost element and is normally open circuit above 35°- 47° Fahrenheit. For this reason it is sometimes difficult to check the continuity of the thermostat unless you are sure that the temperature is low enough to close the circuit. Newer style thermostats may have an internal bias resistor to aid in testing both the thermostat and the heater. The wiring diagram will normally indicate this.\nHow to test a refrigerator’s defrost thermostat with a multi-meter:\n\nBecause you will be testing electrical components, ensure you have disconnected your appliance from the power source before beginning.\n Locate and remove the defrost thermostat in order to test it. In freezer-on-top models, it may be located under the floor of the unit, or it could be found at the back of the freezer. If you have a side-by-side refrigerator, the defrost thermostat is found at the back of the freezer side. You will have to remove any objects that are in your way, such as the contents of the freezer, freezer shelves, icemaker parts, and the inside rear, back, or bottom panel. \nWith your multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, touch the probes to a thermostat wire. When your thermostat is cold, it should produce a reading of zero on your multi-meter. If it is warm (anywhere from forty to ninety degrees Fahrenheit), then this test should produce a reading of infinity.\n If your tests produce different results, then you will need a replacement defrost thermostat.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Refrigerator Thermostats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\n\n\n\nHow to test a defrost thermostat \nHow to replace a defrost thermostat\n\nBack to Top",

If the condenser cannot expel heat efficiently, then the compressor and sealed system work harder to keep the refrigerator cold. Check for higher than normal surface temperatures on the cabinet between the fresh food and freezer doors as this area contains tubing attached to the condenser and will heat up if the condenser cannot be cooled fast enough.\nHow to inspect a refrigerator condenser fan motor:\n\nBefore beginning, ensure that you have disconnected your appliance from the power source, and then locate the condenser fan motor. You will need to remove the rear access panel to find it, it should be near the compressor.\n\nIf the fan motor is seized or worn, you will need a replacement condenser fan motor.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Refrigerator Motors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\nBack to Top",
