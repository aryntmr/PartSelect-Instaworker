    "content": "It's normal for your refrigerator compressor to be warm, however, if it's very hot then there is likely a problem that needs to be addressed. A hot compressor is typically caused by dirty condenser coils, a malfunctioning fan motor, a faulty thermostat, or low refrigerant levels. It can also be caused by something as simple as overloading the fridge with groceries or placing the fridge too close to the wall.  Understanding the root causes of a hot compressor is essential to maintaining your refrigerator’s efficiency and longevity. In this article, we'll explore the common reasons behind a hot refrigerator compressor, and practical step-by-step solutions to help you resolve the issue, and ensure your refrigerator runs smoothly and keeps your food fresh.\n\nThe compressor is a crucial part of the refrigeration cycle, which is the process whereby heat is removed from inside the refrigerator to keep it cool. The compressor pressurizes the refrigerant gas, which is converted into a liquid when it passes through the condenser coils. The liquid evaporates and absorbs heat from the interior of the fridge and cools it down. The cooled air is then circulated throughout the refrigerator to keep the food items cold. The gas returns to the compressor where it begins this cycle again. In summary, the compressor is responsible for pressurizing and circulating the refrigerant throughout the refrigeration system and facilitating the removal of heat from inside the refrigerator to the outside environment.\n\nIf the compressor overheats, it may be unable to compress refrigerant gas effectively, resulting in reduced cooling capacity and longer cooling cycles. It will also consume more energy as it struggles to maintain the desired temperature inside the refrigerator. This can lead to higher electricity bills and unnecessary energy use. Furthermore, overheating over a long period of time can damage the internal components of the compressor, such as the motor windings, and electrical connections. Over time, this can lead to premature compressor failure and the need for costly repairs. If the compressor continues to overheat, it may eventually fail completely. A failed compressor can cause the entire refrigeration system to stop working, leaving your refrigerator unable to function at all. Therefore, if you notice that your compressor is getting hotter than usual, you should address this promptly.\n\nThe condenser coils are designed to release heat generated from inside the refrigerator. When these coils are covered in dust, dirt, or debris, they will be unable to carry out this function efficiently and the overall temperature of the refrigeration system increases. As a result, the compressor has to work harder and run more frequently to maintain the desired internal temperature. Over time, this constant strain can cause the compressor to overheat, increase energy costs, and lower the overall efficiency of the refrigerator.\n\nThe thermostat is designed to monitor the internal temperature of the refrigerator and signal the compressor to turn on or off to maintain the correct temperature. If the thermostat is faulty, it may not accurately read the temperature inside the refrigerator. It may continuously signal the compressor to run even if the temperature is already at the desired level. When the compressor runs continuously without the necessary breaks, it can lead to the compressor becoming extremely hot as it is constantly working to cool down the refrigerator. You will need to replace the refrigerator thermostat to restore the proper functioning of your appliance.\n\nThe condenser fan motor is responsible for cooling the condenser coils and the compressor by circulating air over them, which helps diffuse the heat generated during the refrigeration cycle. If the condenser fan motor fails or operates inefficiently, it can cause inadequate cooling of the condenser coils and compressor. This lack of proper cooling can lead to the compressor overheating. If you are in need of a new refrigerator fan motor you can browse our list of genuine OEM replacement parts to find the right one for your model.\n\nWhen a refrigerator is overcrowded or items are haphazardly placed, it can cause uneven cooling within the compartments, resulting in the compressor running for longer. Additionally, when items are closely packed in together or poorly arranged, it can hinder the airflow through the appliances. The compressor also has to work harder to cool a larger number of items. This forces the refrigerator to work harder to distribute cool air, putting additional strain on the compressor.\n\nWhen the compressor motor receives low voltage, it operates at a lower speed than it is designed for. This reduced speed can lead to decreased efficiency, causing the compressor to work harder to maintain the desired cooling temperature. As a result, the compressor generates more heat. Low voltage can also lead to the overloading of various components within the compressor, such as the motor windings and electrical connections, which also results in increased heat production. Over time, the excessive heat buildup can lead to overheating of the compressor.\n\nIf the refrigerator is too close to the wall, airflow around the condenser coils will become restricted. As a result, the condenser coils cannot effectively release heat, causing the compressor to work harder to maintain the desired temperature inside the fridge. Furthermore, as the compressor struggles to maintain the desired temperature due to the heat buildup, the refrigerator's cooling performance may be compromised. The food items inside the fridge may not be cooled adequately, and the fridge may run longer and more frequently to achieve the set temperature, resulting in higher energy consumption.\n\nTo prevent a hot compressor caused by a fridge being too close to the wall, ensure there is sufficient space around the refrigerator for proper airflow. Pull the fridge forward and leave at least a few inches of clearance between the back of the fridge and the wall, as well as between the sides of the fridge and any nearby objects.\n\nRefrigerant is responsible for cooling various components of the fridge, including the compressor, condenser, expansion valve, and evaporator to facilitate the cooling process. It absorbs heat from the inside of the refrigerator and releases it outside. When the system lacks sufficient refrigerant, the fridge will be unable to function optimally, leading to overheating and reduced cooling efficiency. Some refrigerants are toxic when inhaled and exposure to high concentrations of these refrigerants can cause dizziness, nausea, and respiratory issues. Refrigerants are also highly flammable and therefore pose a serious fire hazard. It is recommended to avoid addressing this issue on your own and to consult a qualified technician who can check the refrigerant levels and refill them if required.\n\nUnderstanding why your fridge compressor may be overheating is crucial for maintaining the efficiency and longevity of your refrigerator. By regularly inspecting and addressing these issues, you can prevent compressor overheating and extend the lifespan of your refrigerator. Simple maintenance tasks like cleaning condenser coils, ensuring proper ventilation around the fridge, and checking refrigerant levels can help alleviate the problem. Remember, a well-maintained compressor leads to a cooler, more efficient fridge, ultimately saving you both energy and money in the long run.\n\nDealing with a torn refrigerator door seal?

    "content": "If you have ice or frost buildup in your freezer, there is typically either an issue with the airflow or with the defrost systems.  In this article we’ll break down the differences between frost and ice buildup, and how the location of the buildup can indicate which part of your freezer is causing the issue. We’ll show you the steps to repair the faulty parts, along with some tips to prevent frost buildup from becoming a recurring problem in your freezer.\n\nTo begin our repair, we’re going to start by completely defrosting the freezer. Please note that any of the repair guides and videos below are general information based on a fridge with freezer on top. The steps will vary based on your appliance model and location of the freezer (such as side-by-side or on the bottom). To find the instructions for your specific freezer, please search for the model number on our YouTube channel.\n\nIf you have frost throughout the freezer, such as along the walls and even on the door, this is due to warm, humid air entering the freezer. Simple things like opening the freezer door too frequently, placing hot food in the freezer, or leaving the door ajar can cause frost to form in these locations. Another cause may be a faulty door gasket. If the freezer door gasket is dirty or damaged, it can prevent the door from tightly sealing, which causes the room temperature air to leak into the freezer. This issue is easy to fix by either cleaning or replacing the gasket.\n\nThe evaporator coils are located behind the back wall of the freezer, and this is typically the coldest spot where frost will form first. Modern fridges have a defrost mode that cycles on, which heats up the evaporator coils to remove any frost buildup. If a component of the defrost cycle is faulty, it can lead to build-up along the back of the freezer walls. The parts that may be causing this issue are the temperature sensor or thermostat, the heater, or the timer. To see if one of these components has failed, you can use a multimeter to test the part. While the exact location and steps to replace each of these components will vary by make and model, the videos below will provide an overview of the procedure.\n\nThe tools you will likely need for this repair may include a Phillips screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, or a quarter-inch nut driver.\n\nThe tools you will likely need may include a Phillips screwdriver, putty knife, needle nose pliers, and a quarter-inch nut driver.\n\nReplacing a defrost thermostat requires a bit of electric work, so you will need a pair of wire cutters and strippers, and some electrical tape or heat shrink for this repair.\n\nIf there is solid ice (not frost) along the bottom of your freezer, there is likely a blockage in the drain hose, causing water to back-flow into the freezer and forming the layer of ice.  The line will need to be flushed out, which can be done with compressed air.\n\nNow that we’ve solved the most common issues and parts that have caused frost build-up in your freezer and cleared it out, it’s time to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Fortunately, basic changes to some of your daily habits can help prevent future frost or ice buildup in your freezer. Since warm, humid air entering the freezer causes frost to form, following these tips can help prevent any issues:\n\nBy following these use-and-care tips, you can ensure that your freezer is running efficiently and frost-free. As with any repair, if it is outside of your comfort zone don’t hesitate to contact your preferred appliance repair technician.\n\nIs your refrigerator's ice maker broken and not working properly?

    "excerpt": "Discover why your Bosch refrigerator's ice maker may be failing to produce ...",
    "content": "If your Bosch ice maker is not producing any ice or it is producing ice very slowly you will first need to check that the water supply and ice maker itself are switched on and the control arm is engaged. Once you have checked these common issues, then you will need to investigate the filter, water line, inlet valve, thermostat, control board, condenser coils, door switch, and door seal for signs of malfunction. Use this guide to help you quickly identify which of these issues are the cause behind your ice-making problems and learn how to fix them using the step-by-step instructions provided.\n\nA defective door seal can allow warm air to enter the refrigerator, causing temperature fluctuations. This can affect the ice maker's ability to freeze water properly and result in less or no ice production.\n\nYour ice maker needs water in order to function properly. A clogged water line will restrict the amount of water that can reach the ice maker, inhibiting ice production. You should also check that the water line is free of any kinks or sharp bends and that it is properly connected to avoid any leaking.\n\nThe water filter traps debris and contaminants and keeps your water fresh and clean. If the water filter is clogged, it can restrict water flow to the ice maker, resulting in reduced or no ice production. It is recommended to replace your filter every six months for optimal efficiency. You can use our Bosch Water Filter Finder to find the right filter for your refrigerator model.\n\nThe door switch detects when the refrigerator door is closed. If the door switch is defective or malfunctioning, it may not signal the ice maker to start the ice-making cycle when the door is closed, resulting in no ice production.\n\nThe water inlet valve controls the flow of water into the refrigerator and ice maker. If the valve is faulty or malfunctioning, it may not supply water to the ice maker properly, resulting in difficulties in producing and dispensing ice.\n\nDirty condenser coils can cause the refrigerator's cooling system to work inefficiently, resulting in higher temperatures. If the refrigerator is not maintaining the proper temperature, it may impact the ice maker's ability to freeze water effectively.\n\nThe ice mold thermostat monitors the temperature of the ice maker mold. If the thermostat is defective, it may not signal the ice maker to release the ice cubes once they are frozen, resulting in a lack of ice production.\n\nThe ice level control board is a component that monitors and controls the ice production and storage process. It's responsible for managing the operation of the ice maker, ensuring that the ice bin doesn't overflow with ice and that the ice maker produces ice as needed.  it can regulate the ice maker's operation, such as controlling the ice maker's water valve to refill the ice tray or stopping the ice production when the bin is full. If the ice maker is not producing enough ice then you will need to inspect and replace the board if necessary.\n\nIf the green light on your ice maker is flashing, this is an indication that the assembly needs to be replaced. Additionally, if you have inspected all the other parts in your ice maker and you are still unable to produce any ice then you'll likely need to replace the ice maker assembly to continue producing ice.\n\nYour ice maker problems may be due to a minor controls board glitch or temporary system error. Resetting your appliance can help with problems like unresponsive controls, low ice production, ice cubes not dispensing properly, or the ice maker not responding to commands. Each refrigerator may have its own resetting protocols, however, you can use this general guide as it is relevant to most models of Bosch refrigerators.\n\nIt can be very frustrating when your ice maker isn't working. However, if you follow the instructions laid out in this guide you should be able to restore your ice maker in no time. Remember that if you are unsure about any steps during the repair, you should not hesitate to seek professional assistance if needed. By giving your Bosch refrigerator proper care and maintenance, your ice maker can continue to provide convenience and refreshment for years to come.\n\nEver wonder why your refrigerator hums or buzzes and makes so much noise, a...\n\nKeep your fridge cold and your food fresh all summer long with this guide.\n\nKeep your freezer ice-cold and free of frost by checking these most common ...",

    "meta_description": "Learn how to troubleshoot and fix a refrigerator that keeps tripping your circuit breaker, whether it's a bad outlet or breaker, or a part like the compressor.",
    "excerpt": "Learn how you can troubleshoot and fix your refrigerator if it keeps trippi...",
    "content": "When your refrigerator is repeatedly tripping the breaker, it could be a problem with the outlet and its wiring, an issue with the circuit, or a problem with a faulty defrost timer/control board or compressor's capacitor. We'll explain what could be going on within your refrigerator or the outlet it's plugged into, and we'll explain exactly how to identify which problem you're dealing with. This troubleshooting guide will take your through all of the possible problems and issues, and will ultimately help you get your refrigerator running again.\n\nThe first step in understanding the why your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is having a solid understanding of each of the affected components that we'll be talking about in this guide. The following is a glossary of parts and terms to provide you with the knowledge you need to get to work.\n\nThe simplest and most common reason a refrigerator, or any appliance, would trip a circuit breaker or fuse box is because it's overloading the overall circuit. Overloading a circuit or fuse means that one appliance or device is drawing too much power it at one given time, compared to the rated capacity of the circuit or fuse. Normally when wiring homes, refrigerators are put on their own designated outlet due to the amount of power they pull, in an effort to curb this from happening. Manufacturers even state that a refrigerator must be on its own independent household circuit, so no other appliance or electrical device should be on the same circuit.\n\nBut there are other reasons why a circuit trips, such as faulty wiring from the outlet itself or the refrigerator connected to it, or if an older model refrigerator simply loses its power efficiency over time.\n\nWhen starting a repair journey like this, it's important to exercise caution whenever dealing with parts in and outside of your refrigerator, especially anything that has an electric current. Remembering to use proper protective equipment, such as insulated work gloves or safety glasses, is important to your safety and wellbeing, and to the overall result of the repair.\n\nThe first place to inspect if you suspect your refrigerator is tripping your circuit breaker is the wall outlet. To do this, you will need a voltage tester/multimeter that can display the output of the power at the outlet itself. That way you can find out if the outlet is outputting the proper voltage for the fridge and any other appliances that may be connected.\n\nWhen doing this, you should start by looking for visual indications of a problem, specifically signs of arcing or burning around the outlet, because those are clear indications of an issue with the outlet and the power cord of your refrigerator. A worn or defective outlet can cause electricity to arc and potentially burn the outlet, and if there are any damaged or exposed wires on the power cord, the outlet can cause issues with it, too. The power cord for your refrigerator can be replaced if it is found to be the cause of the refrigerators issue.\n\nWall outlets are designed to grip the prongs of the cord, and if the prongs are worn or damaged, that grip is lost. If the connection is loose, eventually it will melt the cord and any other plastic (i.e. the outlet cover) in the process. If the connection is poor enough between the prongs and the outlet, electricity will jump the gap and create a spark or arc, which burns even more and accelerates the failure. Test the voltage coming out of the outlet with a voltage tester to ensure you have the proper level between 110-120V. A low voltage will make starting the motor more difficult and could trop a breaker or fuse.\n\nIf the power cord is severely damaged and wires are exposed, it'll need to be replaced as soon as possible with an OEM cord. To do this, you will need work gloves, and a set of pliers. All you need to do is unplug your fridge and pull it out from the wall until you can access it, then unscrew any cover on the rear of the appliance. Follow the cord to where it connects and remove the clamp securing it. Connect the new one and reinstall the clamp, as well as the rear cover of the fridge, before you plug it back in.\n\nIf you don't see any issues with your outlet or the surrounding area, it's time to test your refrigerator to see whether the tripping problem is being caused by the appliance. We recommend  testing the defrost timer and run capacitor in your refrigerator as your next steps, because it they are more likely to be causing the problem, than the breaker or fuse in your home. It makes sense to test and rule these out before exploring more serious electrical inspections. To troubleshoot your refrigerator, you will need a clamp multimeter and a line splitting tool to test the current within its power cord.\n\nFor a refrigerator that's pulling too much power from the wall outlet and overloading the circuit, you will need to troubleshoot and potentially replace one of two parts in your fridge; the compressor's run capacitor, or the defrost timer or control board (depending on your fridge model). If your fridge model is from before 2000 you will likely have a defrost timer, if your model is from 2000-2015 you could have either, and if your fridge was made in the last 10 years (2015 onwards), it likely has a defrost unit within the control board. As we explain below, these parts are essential to the overall function of the refrigerator, and when they fail they can cause the trip you are experiencing. We walk you through how to identify which of these parts is causing the problem in your refrigerator, and we explain how to replace them to get your appliance running!\n\nThe defrost timer and control board and heater are, as their name implies, responsible for the cooling and defrosting process of the refrigerator, which are determined either by a length of time, continuous or while the compressor runs, or by the number of times the doors are opened. They're also two of the most common reasons for a fridge to experience a short or interrupted circuit, due to the heater or timer/control board failing and pulling too much power, and overloading and tripping the outlet. Continue reading to find out how to replace or test your defrost timer or heater!\n\nIf the defrost heater is not the issue, you will need to inspect and potentially replace the defrost timer or control board, depending on your refrigerator model. If your model has a control board instead of a timer, you will need to test the relay board. A relay board will either be built into the back of the fridge (and can only be accessed by pulling the fridge out from the wall) or will be in the same place as the control board.\n\nNote: To ensure that your relay or control board is bad/faulty, have them diagnosed by a qualified technician before purchasing a new one to replace it.\n\nA fridge compressor's capacitor, also known as a relay, is what assists in turning the compressor on and off, depending on the cooling needed. But if the capacitor fails from old age or an electrical surge, it will no longer operate properly and it will overload its outlet, which leads to a short and tripped circuit. If you listen carefully, a failed capacitor will cause the compressor to click when it overloads the circuit. The capacitor will be located at the bottom rear portion of the refrigerator, and can be tested and replaced easily with a set of pliers, screwdriver, wrench, multimeter, and work gloves. Read along and we'll explain exactly how to fix your compressor.\n\nNow that we have ruled out the refrigerator and the outlet it's plugged into, there are a couple more complex issues that could be causing the power to continually trip. We'll walk you through each of those reasons, and what your next steps should be.\n\nElectrical wiring can be complicated, especially for an appliance like a refrigerator. This becomes even more of a nuisance when the problem with an appliance like a refrigerator lies within its wire harnesses. Even though it's a rarity, an incorrectly or improperly routed wire that comes into contact with another wire, can cause one or both to melt and cause a short within the refrigerator's circuit as a result. And in some cases, rodents will find their way into the compressor compartment and chew on the wires, creating a possibility of shorting or overheating. The only way you'd be able to find this issue, however, is by visually inspecting your refrigerator's wires and ensuring such a short does not exist. If you're not comfortable investigating your fridge's circuitry, consider contacting a repair technician to investigate your refrigerator for a short or other issue with its circuitry.\n\nDepending on how recently your home was built, a GFCI (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter) outlet in your home may be tripping from a grounding issue. A grounding issue, or 'fault', happens when the electrical current from your home follows an unintended path to the ground (i.e. damaged wiring, moisture infiltration, etc.). It's worth noting though, that GFCI outlets are not commonly used for circuits with a fridge because they need to be accessible, so you can quickly and easily access them if they trip. This outlet can be replaced with an AFCI outlet, however, it's important to get a qualified electrician's opinion on your home's electrical layout before doing anything yourself.\n\nIf you've inspected your fridge's wiring and your GFCI outlet has no indications of any damage or issue and is still tripping, there are a couple of ways to circumvent your outlet tripping and to get your fridge back and operational again, without needing any tools.\n\nOne proven way to identify any electrical issues you're having with a refrigerator, or any appliance, is to switch its outlet. Whether it's some electrical interference, or if the outlet itself just isn't grabbing and supporting the refrigerator's power cord for any number of reasons, switching the outlet it's plugged into can allow your refrigerator to run, and pinpoint the problem to the outlet itself.\n\nAdding on to the idea of switching outlets, if you need an extension cord to reach a different outlet, use one! But make sure of the extension cord's current rating. The cord will need to have a rating for 15 or 20A to handle the electric current from the wall outlet to the refrigerator without issue. If you've been using an extension cord for your refrigerator and it's not rated to handle 15 or 20A, replace it with one that can immediately. Using an extension cord with too low of an amperage compared to the amperage necessary for the appliance will cause an overload, and lead to the outlet tripping and potentially causing a fire.\n\nNow that your refrigerator is fully back and operational, hopefully you can get back to being able to properly store your food and keep it fresh for longer, without the worry of your fridge turning off or circuit tripping.

    "content": "The refrigerator door seal is a flexible strip of rubber that sits along the edge of the fridge door. It is an airtight seal that prevents cold air from escaping the refrigerator and keeps warm air from entering. If the door seal becomes torn, loose, or dirty, your refrigerator will be unable to cool properly, and your food may eventually become spoiled. The refrigerator will also consume more energy as it has to work harder to maintain the correct temperatures, leading to premature wear and increased energy bills. Finally, if your door seal is faulty, you will also likely notice increased condensation on the interior walls of the refrigerator as well as on your food. Therefore, it is important to fix any tears promptly, perform regular cleaning, or replace the door seal if it is no longer in good working condition.\n\nFood particles, debris, and dirt can accumulate on the surface of the door seal over time. As these contaminants build up, they can cause the seal to become stiff and less flexible. A less flexible seal may not be able to fit properly along the refrigerator door, resulting in gaps or air leaks when the door is closed. Build-up on the door seal may also lead to increased wear and tear. Therefore, if you are having difficulties with your door seal, it is recommended to begin by thoroughly cleaning the seal.\n\nIf your door seal has tears or cracks, you can repair these using silicone glue. It is a professional colorless sealant and it is a popular choice for door seals. You can also utilize PVC glue which is a transparent sealant with a shorter drying time than other glues. It is important to note that using sealants to fix tears in your door seal is a temporary measure and it is best to replace the door seal as a more permanent solution.\n\nBy following the steps outlined in this article, you can quickly and effectively repair your refrigerator door seal. From cleaning and inspecting the seal for damage to using temporary repair methods like silicone sealant and wax paper, there are several ways to deal with common issues with fridge door seals. However, it's important to note that while these repairs can be helpful, replacing a damaged seal with a new one is often the best long-term solution for your refrigerator.\n\nDo you have a refrigerator shelf that's hanging on by a slim piece of plast...\n\nYour refrigerator condenser coils need to be cleaned at least once a year d...\n\nWhether your holiday party this year is big or small, a well-organized refr...",

    "content": "If you’ve been following along with our articles for a while, you’ll know that we often bring up the importance of ensuring you change your fridge water filter on a regular schedule. However, a related topic we haven’t touched on yet is cleaning the water dispenser in your fridge as well. If it’s just dispensing filtered water, it shouldn’t be dirty, right? Unfortunately, that’s incorrect, and the results will likely disgust you. In this article we’ll help you determine if your water dispenser is overdue for a cleaning and walk you through the steps to thoroughly clean your fridge water dispenser and ice maker assembly.\n\nWe suggest deep cleaning your fridge water dispenser system by flushing the water lines every 3-6 months. That is conveniently the same time frame we recommend for changing out your fridge water filter, so you may as well tackle both tasks at the same time! Components like the drip tray and the dispenser nozzle should be wiped down more often, as part of your weekly or monthly kitchen cleaning routine. Any areas of your home that are in constant contact with water (like your shower and tubs, sinks, and laundry machines) require regular cleaning to prevent mold, mildew, and other bacteria from growing. Your fridge water dispenser is no exception. While you may not be able to see if your water dispenser is dirty, there will be symptoms.\n\nJust like replacing the water filter, cleaning the water dispenser is an easy DIY task that only requires a few supplies. A deep cleaning, which includes flushing the water lines, should be done every 3-6 months to help ensure your water tastes fresh.\n\nThe steps provided below will provide a general overview of how to clean your fridge water dispenser. As always when we provide general how-to guides, your fridge’s make and model may not match the steps exactly. Be sure to refer to your owner’s manual to check for specific instructions or guidelines when it comes to cleaning your fridge.\n\nTypically if your fridge has a water dispenser, it also has an ice maker. Cleaning the ice maker can be done at the same time, with only a few extra steps from the water dispenser cleaning process. This will help ensure your ice maker components are clean and your ice cubes are fresh tasting. If while cleaning, you notice that any components are damaged or no longer working, we can help you find OEM icemaker parts for your fridge.\n\nWhen taking care of your regular kitchen cleaning, be sure to include these components of your fridge's water dispenser and ice maker. Keeping on top of these cleaning tasks will make the seasonal deep cleaning of the water dispenser much easier!\n\nKeeping your water dispenser clean is essential for maintaining water quality, preventing buildup, and helping to extend the life of your fridge. With regular cleaning, you can reduce the risk of bacteria and mineral deposits while ensuring every glass tastes fresh. Best of all, the process is simple, affordable, and can be done at home with basic supplies. Making dispenser cleaning part of your fridge maintenance routine (along with changing water filters), will help ensure your water is always fresh and clean.\n\nIs your fridge water filter overdue for a change?\nLearn how filters work, w...\n\nWhen there are water flow issues in your refrigerator the first part to che...\n\nIs your refrigerator's ice maker broken and not working properly?

    "excerpt": "When there are water flow issues in your refrigerator the first part to che...",
    "content": "On refrigerators with ice makers and water dispensers, the inlet valve controls the flow of water into the appliance. When this valve malfunctions, either from a mechanical issue or an electrical failure, you’ll notice problems with your fridge’s water and ice functions. Are your ice cubes coming out smaller than usual? Has your ice maker stopped working? Is the water dispenser slow or not working at all? In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to know about the refrigerator inlet valve, including how to find it, how to test it, and when and how to replace it.\n\nThe water inlet valve on your refrigerator, also known as a solenoid valve, regulates the flow of water into the refrigerator for the ice maker and water dispenser. Understanding what a solenoid is and how it works is key to understanding how the inlet valve functions. Essentially a solenoid is an electrical coil that acts as a switch, when electricity flows through it the switch opens, and when there is no electricity, it closes.\n\nThis valve is integral to controlling the flow of water, it operates much like a faucet, opening and closing valves, the only difference is that it is electronically controlled. When your fridge needs water to fill the ice cube tray, or to fill your cup with water, it signals to the valve that water is needed via an electrical current. That signal is what energizes the solenoid that is in the valve. The signal is constant so as long as the signal is present and the valve is open and water is flowing. When the signal stops the valve closes and the flow of water into the appliance is cutoff.\n\nThis step-by-step breakdown walks you through how the water inlet valve controls the flow of water in your refrigerator. Every time you fill a glass with water, or the ice maker makes another batch the inlet valve is a vital part of the process. Learn how the inlet valve opens and closes, and how it knows when to do that.\n\nNot all refrigerators have a water inlet valve. Your appliance will only have one if it includes an ice maker or a water dispenser. While the exact placement can vary by model, the inlet valve is usually located at the back of the refrigerator near the bottom, where the household water supply connects to the appliance.\n\nYou won’t be able to see this part just by pulling your refrigerator away from the wall. To reach it, you’ll need to remove the lower rear access panel, which is typically a thin sheet of metal or cardboard held in place with screws. This panel protects important and valuable parts, helps reduce dust buildup, minimizes operational noise, and ensures proper ventilation and airflow.\n\nOnce the access panel is removed, you’ll need to locate the inlet valve. Following the water supply line will usually lead you directly to it. The valve is typically secured to the refrigerator cabinet or frame with a metal bracket. The valve itself is made of plastic and is often blue, green, or white.\n\nDue to the fact the inlet valve is an electromechanical device, it can fail in a couple of different ways. As outlined above, the electrical portion tells the valve when to open and close, and the mechanical portion handles the opening and closing of the parts within the valve. If your inlet valve is faulty, it may be due to either an electrical failure or a mechanical failure. Below, we’ll outline both.\n\nMechanical failure is a physical problem with the part and how it functions. Parts within the inlet valve like screens, seals, diaphragms, can get clogged with dirt, debris, and mineral build up. Over time these parts can also deteriorate, wear out, or crack. If any one of these individual parts cannot do its job, the valve will not function properly.\n\nHere are the most common mechanical failures the water inlet valve can experience:\n\nMechanical issues can affect your refrigerator’s ability to fill with water, and they don’t always present as a single problem. You might notice that it fills slowly, doesn’t fill at all, or overfills due to poor regulation. Any time the water levels for these features are off, it’s a sign that the flow of water is not being properly controlled, and the inlet valve could be the cause.\n\nThe water inlet valve is controlled by a solenoid, when it is active the valve is open, and it releases water from the supply line into the refrigerator. If a solenoid no longer has continuity, it will no longer be able to do its job, and the mechanical parts within the valve will not be engaged. It is not uncommon for a solenoid to fail or wear out over time.\n\nSome common electrical issues are:\n\nIf the inlet valve on your refrigerator is failing that will manifest itself as issues with your ice maker and water dispenser. The water inlet valve supplies the refrigerator with the water it needs for these features to operate. The failure of this part might not be sudden, in the lead up to failure you might notice these features only working intermittently and it could be a sign the part is beginning to fail. Any time you notice performance issues with your ice maker or water dispenser it could be a sign that there are issues with the inlet valve.\n\nFinally, a failing inlet valve can lead to water leaking from your fridge, often it is localized to the area around the valve itself. Which means if there is a leak behind your refrigerator it is very likely the inlet valve is the source.\n\nWhen you are testing the water inlet valve you are going to do it in phases, and we will walk you through that here. You will start by checking the household water supply line, if there are no issues with the water supply to the fridge that will tell you the issue is with the valve. Then testing the solenoid portion of the valve with a multimeter will tell you if the issue is electronic or not. If it is not then you have a mechanical issue with your valve.\n\nThere are some other causes of ice maker and water dispenser issues. Before you pull out your refrigerator and get to work you might want to do a few small checks to rule out any other explanations for these problems.\n\nIf your ice maker is not making any ice at all, before you jump to any conclusions about the water supply and the inlet valve, you should check the bail arm on your ice maker. If it is stuck in the engaged position the ice maker will not make ice, as it thinks the ice bin is full of ice and no additional ice is needed. This simple check could save you a lot of trouble.\n\nIf the issue you are having is related to the flow of water from the dispenser, if it is slow and lacks pressure you should first rule out any issues with the water filter. If it is clogged, or if it has not been replaced in a long time, that could be the reason there is restricted flow of water in your refrigerator.\n\nThe first step in the troubleshooting process will be to test the water supply, to make sure that the pressure and flow of water from your house to your refrigerator is sufficient. If it is not, the problem lies in the water supply rather than the inlet valve.\n\nOnce you have ruled out water supply issues and have turned the water supply off, it is time to move on to the next steps of the investigation. At this point, you know there could be a problem with the inlet valve, and you will need to access and inspect the part.\n\nThe next step in the testing process involves removing the inlet valve from your refrigerator. Follow these step-by-step instructions to get that done:\n\nOnce you have removed the inlet valve from the refrigerator you will want to visually inspect the part for any issues. Here are some of the things you will be looking for:\n\nIf you have made it this far and still have found no obvious faults or issues with the inlet valve you will want to test the valve for continuity.\n\nIf a solenoid fails the continuity test, it confirms an electrical fault, and the inlet valve will need to be replaced. If all solenoids test within the proper range, then the inlet valve is not the source of the problem.\n\nWith any electrical faults it is obvious the valve would need to be replaced, but it is also our recommendation that the same is true for mechanical faults. Trying to clean and replace the internal parts of the valve is not a long-term reliable solution and comes with increased risk of failure.\n\nYour water inlet valve should be replaced if you have done the above troubleshooting and you have found:\n\nIf you have already done the hard work of removing this part for testing, there is no reason you cannot do the replacement yourself. It is simple and you'll save significantly on the price of hiring a repair person. You simply need to use the model number on your refrigerator to find the refrigerator inlet valve designed to fit your model. You will then need to connect the wires to the new part, connect the water line, install it on the mounting bracket and connect the supply line.\n\nWithout a properly working inlet valve, your refrigerator cannot provide the ice and water you rely on. Once the problem is confirmed and the valve is replaced, your fridge will return to normal operation with steady water flow, consistent ice production, and fewer worries about leaks. It may be a small component, but it plays a big role in keeping your refrigerator dependable and convenient every day.\n\nIs your refrigerator's ice maker broken and not working properly?

    "excerpt": "Fridges make a variety of banging, popping, and knocking noises during thei...",
    "content": "It’s normal for loud banging or knocking noises to come from your fridge occasionally. Your fridge runs with on/off cycles and often contains moving parts, heavy objects, and ice that will clink and clang. All of these elements can make jolting, knocking, or banging noises as part of regular operation. But that doesn’t mean your fridge making a banging noise should be ignored. Sometimes, non-repair issues need to be solved, like an uneven level or a frosting issue. If these don’t fix the noise, you may need to perform a repair on the fan blades, ice maker, or compressor. If you’re lucky, what you’re hearing is just a normal cycle switch-on noise from the compressor, ice falling heavily into an empty compartment, or the ice maker arm moving into position. Whether it’s nothing to worry about, a quick fix, or something that involves a part replacement, this guide will help stop the startling noises and get your fridge back to normal.\n\nSometimes your fridge will make noises that sound like bangs or knocks or sharp sudden sounds, and it can be a little surprising. However, these noises can occur for a variety of reasons, from completely normal fridge operation to something that requires further examination. Here are some things to check before you worry about bigger operational issues with your appliance.\n\nIf your fridge has an ice maker, it is common for the ice to bang loudly as it falls into the bin. This can be jolting and often lines up with \"evening banging\" if you've been using your ice maker a lot throughout the day and night. As the ice refills in the evening, people often report loud banging noises that coincide with the nighttime, but it's mainly because their ice supply is being refilled from empty, which makes louder noises as ice falls into an empty plastic bin. Some noises are also common during the ice maker’s “harvest cycle”. For example, sometimes when the ice maker's arm is pushing ice out, or going back into position after pushing ice into your bin, it can make a slow clunking noise; another normal sound that is no cause for concern. However, if the noises from your ice maker sound worse and unnatural, or are becoming more regular, jump down to our Ice Maker section for inspection tips.\n\n“Water hammer” is a sound that occurs sometimes in fridges, faucets and other appliances with a water line, and it happens when the water valve on the appliance opens and closes, causing a pressure change accompanied by a bang/pop. This can be caused by fast-closing water valves (like many ice makers/fridges have), high water pressure in the home, or issues with the piping/plumbing. Although not a critical issue, if it's annoying you and can be traced back to the refrigerator's water line, installing a water hammer arrestor on the cold-water supply line in front of the fridge's inlet valve can solve the problem.\n\nFor this simple job you’ll just need to purchase a water hammer arrestor, sized for a 3/8-inch or half-inch line depending on your fridge. An adjustable wrench and some Teflon tape will help make the task simpler.\n\nIf a lower-pitched or more mechanical thump or hum is the noise you're describing and it's a routine one-time sound that seems to align with when the cooling cycle would be coming on or off, it's likely the compressor functioning as it should. Your fridge is constantly cycling between cooling and defrost modes, and the compressor \"compresses\" refrigerant to control the cooling cycle when the fridge needs to come down in temperature. A noise when this cycle commences is normal and expected, but as we'll explain later in the article, there are times when compressor noises can be a cause for concern.\n\nSometimes, when the refrigerator is getting cold again after being opened, plastic and metal components, particularly the evaporator coil, can make sharp popping noises as they contract with the increased blast of cold as the refrigerator re-cools. If the banging noise tends to occur in conjunction with the sounds of the compressor doing its thing, this is not a cause for concern, and just a natural function of the refrigerator's cooling process.\n\nSometimes, if your fridge was not correctly leveled, ice, lighter objects, condiments, and whatnot can move around, especially if they were moved recently or the fridge was recently closed aggressively (thanks kids!). No, your fridge isn't haunted by people moving stuff around inside, it could just be unlevel, and the glass surfaces of most shelves combined with glass/plastic bottles can make it easy for things to shift internally.\n\nThis is a simple job that will just require a wrench and a basic spirit level (you can use a free phone app if you don’t have a physical level). Generally, you’ll want your fridge to be mostly level with a very slight lean towards the back, to allow the doors to close more easily after a light push.\n\nIf you’ve gone through the above list of regular non-repair causes of a noisy fridge and determined that none of these are the issue, you may be dealing with a faulty part that requires inspection.\n\nThis is the most likely culprit for a banging or knocking noise that won’t go away. If the compressor itself is failing, unfortunately it’s a repair we don’t recommend doing yourself, as it can involve working with dangerous refrigerant, but there are also instances where the issue can be fixed before a complete replacement is required. Here’s how to check your fridge’s compressor.\n\nThere are two different types of fan blades in your fridge that can cause banging or knocking noises if they’re warped, affected by ice or debris, or are hitting other internal parts. These are the evaporator fan blades, and the condenser fan blades, and we will walk you through troubleshooting both. A good clue that it's fan blades causing the issue is if the knocking or banging noise you're hearing is less sudden and isolated, and more repetitive and predictable. Something closer to a \"knock knock knock knock knock\" than a sudden, sharp \"bang\"! As the various fans in your fridge spin and come into contact with things, it will happen repeatedly, and so will the noise. If this describes the sound you're hearing, look no further.\n\nEvaporator fan problems occur when this part, which lives in your freezer and circulates cold air throughout your appliance, freezes up partially, or comes into contact with ice as it spins. The resulting noise can be constant banging or knocking, which you might be able to identify by its consistency, and location being pinpointed to the freezer. Here’s how to check your evaporator fan.\n\nCondenser fan motor issues can happen when this part, which is located at the bottom rear of your fridge, near the condenser coils, is coming into contact with other parts, debris under the fridge, dust bunnies, or is otherwise loose. The condenser fan helps cool your condenser coils and compressor, and starts running during the cooling cycle when your compressor kicks on. If the noise does seem to be related to this compressor cycle, but you’ve not been able to attribute the noise to the compressor itself, the condenser fan motor is one to check.\n\nAs we covered above, some noises are normal as part of the ice maker’s \"harvest\" cycle, as internal components move and activate to fill your ice molds, dump them into your tray, and move the ice towards your dispenser. But humidity can cause excess ice to form in your freezer and around your ice maker, and the ice maker will still try to carry out its duties even when things are frozen over or ice is in the way. This can cause unnatural banging/knocking noises. Here’s how to check things out.\n\nRefrigerators work hard to perform their cycles and functions, and some knocking, banging, buzzing, and humming are all to be expected, but it shouldn’t be something that causes you to constantly jump out of your seat, and that’s why we’re glad you found this guide! Whether it’s a regular noise from your refrigerator that causes the occasional jump scare, a quick issue solved by a re-levelling or defrosting, or something a little more involved, we hope this article has helped you get to the bottom of your fridge knocking issue.

    "excerpt": "Ever wonder why your refrigerator hums or buzzes and makes so much noise, a...",
    "content": "Quiet humming or buzzing noises coming from your refrigerator are completely normal. Refrigerator compressors normally produce a low humming noise during various portions of the day, since they're essentially the refrigerator's motor. The evaporator also produces noise, although it's usually not as loud as the compressor is. However, if there is a louder-than-usual hum coming from your refrigerator, it may be a sign of frost buildup around the evaporator, or an aging and failing compressor. Then, if you are hearing extremely loud humming noises, there may be an issue with the condenser or evaporator fan that we will break down for you how to fix below, along with step-by-step video guides!\n\nOccasional, low noises coming from your refrigerator are completely normal, and nothing to be concerned about – but there are definitely some noises that you will want to take more seriously than others. Here is a list of most refrigerator noises you'll hear, and what they mean:\n\nIf the evaporator fan in your refrigerator is blocked by ice, if its airway is blocked by food items, or if its motor is bad and needs replacing, your refrigerator will begin to hum or buzz loudly. Luckily, the evaporator can be fixed, and doing so is a repair that anyone can do!\n\nDepending on your refrigerator model, food items can block and clog the airway of the evaporator fan, preventing it from properly distributing cool air within the cabinet of the refrigerator and causing both the compressor and evaporator to work harder and hum or buzz distinctly loud. Simply moving food out of the way of the fan and clearing off any built-up frost should fix the humming and noise issue.\n\nEvaporator fans help maintain the internal temperature in your refrigerator. They pull warm air from the appliance through the evaporator coils to cool it. Depending on the model of refrigerator, the evaporator fan motor may also be used to circulate that cooled air. However, if the defrost system malfunctions or if any parts within it don't work properly, the fan mechanism will experience frost buildup and produce a humming or buzzing noise. If your refrigerator is experiencing defrost issues and significant frost buildup, we have a general how-to guide on how to fix it!\n\nIf the evaporator fan blade does not move freely within the evaporator mechanism, it means that the motor is bad or broken and needs replacing in order to function properly. Fortunately, we have a huge inventory of OEM refrigerator evaporator fan motors, and the guide you need to properly replace it:\n\nBelow is a general video guide showing how to replace a refrigerator evaporator fan motor.\n\nThe defrost system within your refrigerator, made up of the defrost timer, thermostat, and heater, is designed to melt ice and frost buildup within the cooling systems of the fridge. This is done to ensure your food items are kept cold at all times, without the risk of frost or ice building up and causing issues. If either of these parts fails or stops working properly, ice and frost will buildup and the evaporator fan will eventually begin making a humming or buzzing noise.\n\nFor this repair, you will need a screwdriver, and you may require a wire stripper and crimper, heat-shrinking tubes, a heat gun, and a new defrost thermostat which you can find in our wide range of OEM refrigerator thermostats.\n\nBelow is a general video guide on how to replace the defrost thermostat.\n\nIf you've replaced the defrost thermostat and frost is continuing to buildup, it's likely an issue with the defrost heater, which is supposed to activate and melt any and all ice or frost. Replacing this part is not difficult, and likely will only require a screwdriver and a new defrost heater which you can find in our selection of OEM refrigerator elements and burners.\n\nBelow is a general video guide for how to replace a refrigerator defrost heater.\n\nIf you've replaced your refrigerator's defrost thermostat and heater, and you are still finding frost buildup around the evaporator fan causing it to hum, the defrost timer is likely bad and not running for as long as necessary. For this repair, you will need a screwdriver and a new defrost timer, which you can conveniently find in our inventory of OEM refrigerator timers!\n\nBelow is a general video guide on how to replace the defrost timer.\n\nIf you've replaced the evaporator fan motor, defrost timer, thermostat, and heater, and your refrigerator is continuing to produce loud or abnormal humming or buzzing noises, it is likely an issue with its compressor. Compressor repairs are quite costly and difficult to do, even for repair-savvy individuals, because of the hazardous and toxic materials, like refrigerant, used within refrigerators – this is why we recommend compressor repairs be left to qualified repair technicians.\n\nFor all other refrigerator or non-refrigerator-related repair and home improvement blog articles, stay tuned to our PartSelect blog!

    "content": "Is your Frigidaire fridge acting up, leaving you with lukewarm drinks and thawing food? Resetting your Frigidaire refrigerator can often work wonders, and help you tackle issues from temperature problems to control panel glitches. In this article, we'll show how to perform a soft reset and a hard reset of your Frigidaire fridge and help you understand when and why it might be necessary, such as after a power surge or when the fridge is displaying an error code. Whether you're facing a minor glitch or major malfunctions, a reset could be just the ticket to restore your appliance's cool confidence.\n\nFirst, check if your fridge has a Reset button on the control panel at the front of the fridge. Once you have located it, press and hold the button for 5 seconds. If there is no Reset button, press and hold the Crush button for 5 seconds instead. You may see lights flashing on the control panel flash or hear a beeping as the fridge returns to its default settings. Once the reset process is complete, monitor how your refrigerator is performing over the next few hours to ensure that it is functioning properly again.\n\nIf using the Reset button or Crush button does not reset the refrigerator, you can perform a hard reset instead. Locate the circuit breaker in your home and look for the switch that corresponds to the refrigerator. Flip the switch to the off position and wait at least 5 minutes to allow the refrigerator to completely power down. Turn the switch back on and allow the fridge to recalibrate itself. You should hear the compressor and fans running, which indicates that power has been restored. Once the fridge is fully powered up you can check to see if it's functioning properly and if there are no longer any error codes or control panel issues.\n\nKnowing when and how to reset your Frigidaire fridge can be a valuable skill for maintaining its optimal performance and extending its lifespan. Whether you're experiencing temperature fluctuations, malfunctioning displays, or other issues, a reset can often provide a simple solution. By following the steps outlined in this guide and understanding the common reasons why a reset may be necessary, you can ensure that your Frigidaire refrigerator continues to keep your food fresh and your kitchen running smoothly. However, if resetting does not resolve the issue, then your fridge may need repair. You can use our model search feature to find genuine OEM Frigidaire refrigerator parts for your appliance.

    "excerpt": "Is your fridge water filter overdue for a change?\nLearn how filters work, w...",
    "content": "If your fridge water has been tasting off, or you've been having issues with it not dispensing water, or not making ice, it may be trying to tell you that it’s time to change the water filter. Your fridge may even have an indicator light or display to alert you as well! If you’ve been putting off this task (or perhaps have never ever changed the water filter), it’s time to start! Why should you bother? Filters help ensure your drinking water is free of contaminants, and keep your water dispenser and ice maker working efficiently. In this article we’ll discuss how a water filter works and what it filters out, how long a water filter lasts, and how often you should change it, along with the steps to remove and replace your fridge water filter.\n\nThe water filter in your fridge works by trapping contaminants before they enter the water dispenser or ice maker. The first step is trapping larger particulars like sand or silt to improve the clarity, then medium and microscopic contaminants are absorbed by the carbon core. Over time, the carbon will become saturated with these contaminants and will fail to continue filtering. It is important to change the filter on a regular (typically every 6 months) basis to keep your drinking water fresh.\n\nAs water travels, it picks up impurities and contaminants both from the natural environment and from cities, homes, and farms. Water that has not been filtered can contain minerals, chemicals, bacteria, and microscopic organisms that can create an unpleasant flavor and, in some cases, can cause potentially harmful illnesses.\n\nIf your home is on municipal water services, it will already be treated for anything harmful, but it may contain the following:\n\nIf you get your water from a well, there is the potential for it to contain a variety of potential contaminants. Well water is not required to abide by specific water guidelines. It is the owner’s responsibility to test the well at least once a year (depending on your local conditions) due to continually fluctuating ground conditions. These contaminants are not necessarily present in your well water but are commonly found:\n\nTo know exactly what your water filter removes, make sure you read the label of your filter carefully.  If your filter is NSF Certified, you can search the NSF database to understand what your model is certified to protect against. NSF stands for National Sanitation Foundation and the NSF mark is an assurance that your filter has been tested by a trustworthy impartial certification organization, and all of its contaminant reduction assertions are truthful and correct. On your fridge water filter label look for NSF/ANSI 42, which filters \"aesthetic effects\" like chlorine and sediments (like sand and silt) and improves the taste and odor of your water. For \"health effects\" looks for NSF/ANSI 53 on the label. This standard removes contaminants like lead, mercury, VOCs, and cysts/parasites. To remove contaminants like nitrates, arsenic, and fluoride, you may require more advanced systems than a fridge water filter, such as reverse osmosis or UV lights.\n\nPartSelect.com only sells NSF certified and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) water filters. When you purchase the water filter for your specific model of fridge, it is manufacturer guaranteed to fit and treat your water properly. While non-certified or after-market filters may look similar, they do not offer the same filtration and fit guarantee that a certified filter does. An inaccurate size can result in water flowing around the filter instead of through, allowing contaminants into your drinking water. You can read our article on OEM to learn more about the difference OEM products make,\n\nManufacturers recommend that you change your filter every six months with regular water usage. Most filters are able to process 200-400 gallons of water before becoming clogged, so if a family of 4 drinks the recommended 8-cups of water per day, you should get between 3-6 months out of your filter. If you use your water dispenser more than average or have poor water conditions due to your location, it may need to be changed more frequently.\n\nOther signs you may need to replace your filter:\n\nFailure to change your filter at least every six months will allow contaminants to saturate your filter, causing it to leak the potentially toxic chemicals back into your drinking water. With an outdated filter, your water may even contain more pollutants than unfiltered water. Neglecting to change the filter can also reduce the water pressure in the filtering system and can lead to a buildup of lime scale which can wreak havoc on your appliance. Not to mention, an expired filter could cause a change in taste and odor.\n\nReplacing the filter every six months is a simple maintenance task with so many benefits. If you’re struggling to remember, signing up for a water filter subscription program will remind you. A new filter will be shipped right to your door every six months (or the cycle of your choosing). Simply install the new filter once it arrives, and continue to enjoy fresh, clean drinking water.\n\nThe location of the water filter in your fridge will depend on your make and model. With the various styles of fridges available today (top freezer, bottom freezer, French door, or side by side as examples) there isn’t a universal location water filters can be found. Your user manual will be able to tell you the exact location of the filter in your fridge. However here are some common locations to check and the typical method to remove them:\n\nYou can also use our Water Filter Finder to find the filter location and appropriate water filter for your refrigerator model.\n\nJust like the location of the water filter, how to remove and replace it will vary depending on your fridge model. No matter what style of fridge you have, changing the water filter is a very simple process that shouldn’t require any tools. Below, we have covered the steps for changing four of the most common types of water filters. If you have a different type, refer to your fridge’s user manual for the exact steps for your model.\n\nThis style of water filter will typically be found in the fridge’s interior, or down at the base grille. The steps to change this filter are the same for either location.\n\nAfter you replace the filter, you should flush the system before drinking the water. A lot of filters are carbon-based and will need to have water run through them to flush out any excess carbon residue, which can produce a bitter taste to your water. This will also get rid of air bubbles caught in the system. Each filter will have its own flush time written in its instruction guide.\n\nMost modern refrigerators will have a water filter indicator light used to notify you when it is time to replace your filter. Some indicator lights or messages will automatically reset once you have installed the new filter, but many do not. If the light is still flashing red or indicating the need to replace it after you have installed your new filter, this is because it needs to be manually reset. Generally, this is done by pressing and holding the button down for a few seconds. For more information, check your user manual for instructions specific to your model.\n\nRegularly replacing the water filter is essential for both the quality of your drinking water and the health of your refrigerator. Filters play a critical role in removing impurities, improving taste, and preventing harmful contaminants from entering your water supply. Neglecting to replace them can lead to poor water quality, unpleasant odors, and even damage to your appliance. By following the manufacturer’s guidelines for replacing the filter every six months, you ensure fresh, safe water for your household. A simple routine like this not only protects your family but also extends the life of your fridge, making it a small but impactful step toward better home maintenance.\n\nNoticing a distinct odor or taste in your water or ice after it's dispensed...\n\nWhen the red filter indicator light appears on your Samsung fridge, your wa...\n\nWe use three refrigerator models to show you how to easily change your wate...",

    "content": "Ensuring your fridge is set to a specific temperature not only keeps your food fresh, but it is also an important safety feature. When food is stored at the optimal temperature, it prevents harmful bacteria from growing. So what temperature is ideal for both your fresh food in the fridge, and frozen items in the freezer? Is the coldest setting the best to use? In this article we’ll discuss the different options for your fridge and freezer, food storage tips, and how to adjust the settings for your refrigerator.\n\nTo prevent foodborne illnesses, your fridge needs to be kept at a temperature under 40F (4C). The ideal range however is between 35-38F (or approximately 1-3C) so that your food is thoroughly chilled without freezing. To keep the items in your freezer frozen solid, you will want the temperature to be set to 0F or lower (-18C or colder).\n\nAn inexpensive thermometer placed in the fridge can help ensure that the appliance is set to (and maintaining) the correct temperature. Some factors to consider when it comes to your fridge temperature are the age of appliance and how full it is. An older or fully stocked fridge may need a lower setting to maintain a cooler temperature. It’s important to note that you shouldn’t jam your fridge or freezer full, as air flow is essential to maintaining the temperature.\n\nWhether your fridge is an older base model, or a newer style with a digital display, adjusting the temperature is a simple task.\n\nIf your fridge has a dial to adjust the temperature, it's as simple as turning the knob to raise or lower the temperature. Most fridge models will have a range of 1 to 5 for the settings, but what do these mean as far as temperatures go? The higher the number, the colder the temperature. The lower the number, the warmer the temperature. If you set the dial at “1” it should keep your fridge around 39F, whereas a setting of 5 should be around 33F so that your food doesn’t freeze. Most models will have an “ideal temperature” marker on the dial. This is a good setting to start with, and you can then adjust the temperature dial from there if you need more or less cooling.\n\nIf you have a fridge with a digital control board, you should be able to select the exact temperature you want for the fridge and freezer. As mentioned above, your fridge should be below 40F to prevent bacteria from growing, and the freezer should be below 0F to keep your food frozen. The process to select the temperature will vary depending on your fridge model, but it should be very straightforward, typically just pushing an up-arrow or down-arrow button to adjust the temperature.\n\nWhile the temperature in your fridge is essential to prevent bacteria from growing, where you place different foods in your fridge also helps keep things fresher for longer. There are different temperature “zones” with the door being one of the warmer areas, and the bottom shelves or crispers being the cooler areas. It is good food-safety practice to not store highly perishable items like milk on the door, and to keep items like meat on the lower shelves. You can learn more, including how to set your crisper humidity levels, by reading our article on proper food storage.\n\nIf there is bad weather that may cause a power outage, there are also steps you can take to help prevent your food from spoiling. Our article on food safety during a power outage can help you prepare for these events.\n\nIf you’ve tried adjusting the temperature in your fridge, and it isn’t staying cold, it’s likely that a part has failed. The fans or compressor may not be working, which is going to leave you with a warm fridge and spoiled food. If you don’t hear any fans running, this may indicate that you have a problem with the controls, which could be a dial or electronic. If the fans on your refrigerator are running but not the compressor, it is likely a problem with the start device for that compressor. Most compressors use either a relay overload device or a start device. You can learn how to correct these issues with our article about refrigerators not cooling.\n\nIf the temperature setting in your fridge is too low, it may cause some items to freeze, especially those located at the back. Bumping the temperature up a degree or two should resolve this. If there is persistent frost however, there may be an issue with one of the controls. If the temperature control, damper control, or the electronic control have failed, it can result in temperature imbalances in your fridge which could be causing your fresh food to freeze. Learn how to diagnose and resolve this issue with our article about why your fridge is freezing food.\n\nMaintaining the ideal temperature of 35-38F in your fridge is essential for keeping you and your household safe. This keeps your food fresh and helps to prevent bacteria from growing, which can cause various foodborne illnesses. Adjusting the temperature is a simple process, and keeping a thermometer in the fridge is an inexpensive way to check that temperatures are maintained. If your fridge is running hot or starts freezing food, we can help walk you through a repair and provide genuine replacement parts for your fridge.\n\nKeep your fridge cold and your food fresh all summer long with this guide.\n\nDon't let a power outage ruin your good food!

    "content": "Whether you're restocking groceries or preparing for gatherings, Power Cool is a feature available on many Samsung refrigerators, designed to rapidly lower the temperature inside the fridge compartment. Power Cool is commonly used after grocery shopping, when preparing for gatherings, or during hot weather conditions. To activate Power Cool, you can use either the control panel on the refrigerator or the Family Hub app. Factors influencing the duration of Power Cool include initial temperature, amount and temperature of contents, room temperature, refrigerator age, frequency of door openings, and the size and model of the refrigerator. If Power Cool is not working, you can try resetting the refrigerator to restore it to its original settings. Ultimately, Samsung's Power Cool feature offers a convenient way to ensure your food stays cool and your groceries remain fresh for longer. Follow this guide to learn how to get the most out of this feature!\n\nPower Cool allows you to lower the temperature inside the refrigerator compartment quickly. When Power Cool is activated, the refrigerator begins to run the compressor at a higher capacity to help cool down the interior rapidly. This feature allows you to instantly chill the food items stored in the fridge compartment.\n\nThe Power Freeze feature works similarly to the Power Cool feature by running the compressor at a higher capacity, but it is used for the freezer compartment. It is designed to rapidly freeze items and is usually activated when you need to quickly freeze fresh groceries or items such as ice cream. The Power Freeze function also shortens the amount of time needed to produce ice from the ice maker. It is best to activate Power Freeze one full day before you place items in the freezer. Once it is activated, Power Freeze will run for 50 hours before gradually returning to the normal freezer temperature. To activate and deactivate it, simply press and hold the Freezer button for 3 seconds or select the Power Freeze option in your Family Hub account.\n\nIt generally takes approximately two hours for the fridge to fully cool after Power Cool is activated. Once the temperature reaches 1°C the Power Cool function switches off. After several hours the fridge will gradually return to its normal temperature.\n\nPower Cool is a powerful and convenient way to cool the interior of the fridge. You can use Power Cool in the following scenarios to help get the most out of your appliance:\n\nLocate the \"Fridge\" button on the control panel of your refrigerator. Press and hold the button for 3 seconds and wait for the corresponding display to light up. This indicates that Power Cool is now running You can switch off the Power Cool function by pressing and holding the button again until the indicator light switches off.\n\nFirst ensure that your Samsung refrigerator is connected to your home Wi-Fi network and that you have the SmartThings App installed on your phone or tablet. Log in to your account and connect the refrigerator to your Family Hub account. Navigate to the Fridge Manager button and click on it. Tap on the toggle labeled Power Cool to activate Power Cool in your fridge. Once Power Cool has been activated, you can monitor the temperature inside the refrigerator from your phone. You may also receive notifications or updates through the Family Hub app.\n\nThe duration of the Power Cool feature can be influenced by several factors:\n\nIf the Power Cool feature is not working, it may be due to a minor system glitch in the refrigerator. It is common for users to run into technical problems every so often. You can fix this issue by resetting the refrigerator. This will clear out any old settings and restore the fridge to its default settings. You can follow any of the methods below to rest your Samsung fridge.\n\nLocate the Reset button on the control panel on the refrigerator. Once you have found it, press and hold the button for 3 - 5 seconds. The control panel should light up as it resets. Once the display has returned to normal check that the fridge is running properly again.\n\nIf your Samsung fridge does not have a Reset button, you can use the Power Cool and Power Freeze buttons to reset the fridge instead. Press and hold the buttons together, at the same time for 10 seconds. You should hear a chime as the refrigerator resets itself.\n\nOpen the Family Hub App on your phone and click on the Settings button. Scroll down to the option that says \"About Family Hub\". Select the \"Factory data reset\" option and then press on the \"RESET\" option. The app will then prompt you to press \"RESET\" again. Finally, press \"Delete all data\".\n\nGo to the electrical panel in your home and find the switch that corresponds to the refrigerator. Flip the switch and leave it turned off for at least five minutes. This allows the electronic controls and components to reset completely. Turn the switch back on and allow the fridge to power on and stabilize. Verify that the refrigerator is functioning properly again after the hard reset.\n\nA common problem that Samsung fridge users face is the Power Freeze function cycling on on its own. This typically indicates a stuck key or an internal fault within the display panel on the front of the refrigerator. You can browse our list of genuine OEM Samsung refrigerator parts to find a replacement for your model! To remove the display panel, first locate and unthread the mounting screws(s) located on the underside of the panel. Once you have done so you can grip the bottom of the panel with both hands and pull it out of the housing. Disconnect the wire connector and discard the old panel. Attach the wire connector to your new display panel and pop it back into the housing. Remember to rethread the mounting screw to hold it in place.\n\nSamsung's Power Cool feature is a powerful tool designed to rapidly cool down your refrigerator's interior, ensuring your groceries stay fresh for longer. By activating this feature strategically during periods of high usage or after loading in a large batch of warm items, you can maintain optimal temperature levels and preserve the quality of your stored food. Remember that while Power Cool is incredibly effective, using it excessively can lead to unnecessary energy consumption. So be sure to follow the guidelines set out above on when and how to use the Power Cool feature for maximum efficiency.\n\nIf your Samsung ice maker is not working, it can be very frustrating.
