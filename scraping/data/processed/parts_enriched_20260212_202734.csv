The Door Shelf Retainer Bar, also known as a refrigerator door rack, is a white, plastic part which can be easily installed onto your fridge door.  It holds items in your fridge and will show physical damage if broken, at which time it should be replaced. Check your user manual and model number to see if this part is right for you. To install this part, you will need to remove the old one by unlocking the tabs, which can be slid with your fingers. To install the new shelf, line it up with the shelf cut-outs, over the tabs, and gently press it down to lock it into place. This part generally fits the middle door shelf of refrigerators. This is a part that frequently requires multiple parts per refrigerator. Because it is sold individually, you will need to purchase as many door racks as necessary to complete your repair.","Fridge falling apart | Shelf Retainer Bar | The door shelf retainer bars cracked. | Door shelf broke in half | Door shelf retainer bar snapped easily into  place. | Old gasket was cracked, dirty, and causing the refrigerator to run overtime. | 2 shelves were broken and missingg | Door retainer bars were broken | retainer bar on the door split in the middle, Handle broke and the screws, draw railsnapped | Retainer bar was broken.",AP3214631 | 948952 | 240534701,Really Easy,Less than 15 mins,2-3 business days,In Stock Add to cart,https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/734936-1-N-Frigidaire-240534701-Door-Shelf-Retainer-Bar.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGlCNEgLfM0,https://www.partselect.com/PS734936-Frigidaire-240534701-Door-Shelf-Retainer-Bar.htm?SourceCode=18,30,2026-02-11 14:27:31.678103,2026-02-11 14:27:31.678103,"[{""model_number"": ""25331113300"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/25331113300/""}, {""model_number"": ""25331113302"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/25331113302/""}, {""model_number"": ""25331113304"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/25331113304/""}, {""model_number"": ""25331113308"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/25331113308/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330A"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330A/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330B"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330B/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330C"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330C/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330D"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330D/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330E"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330E/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330F"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330F/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330G"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330G/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330H"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330H/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330J"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330J/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330K"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330K/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111330L"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111330L/""}, {""model_number"": ""25331115300"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/25331115300/""}, {""model_number"": ""25331115302"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/25331115302/""}, {""model_number"": ""25331115304"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/25331115304/""}, {""model_number"": ""25331115308"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/25331115308/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530A"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530A/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530B"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530B/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530C"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530C/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530D"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530D/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530E"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530E/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530F"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530F/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530G"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530G/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530H"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530H/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530J"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530J/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530K"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530K/""}, {""model_number"": ""2533111530L"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/2533111530L/""}]"

This manufacturer-approved Refrigerator Pantry End Cap Kit, also known as the Refrigerator Drawer Support, is a kit containing all parts of the Pantry End Cap.  It snaps into place on the appliance’s pantry drawer to help contain the items inside and to keep your refrigerator door from sliding all the way out. It is rated as ""medium"" difficulty to install, is constructed of plastic and comes in white. If broken or missing, the pantry drawer will not stay in place and the part should be replaced. Refer to your user manual and model number to ensure this is the correct part for you. This kit includes both the right and left side end caps, as well as the pins that will hold them in place. To replace an end cap, remove the three screws holding it in place. Then, remove the pin and end cap, replacing the old end cap with the new end cap. In the past, the left and right end caps were sold separately, but the part has been updated and now includes both sides.

This NSF-certified water filter helps to improve the taste, quality, and health of your water by removing a number of contaminants including mercury, lead, and trace pharmaceuticals. The filter should be replaced every six month or after 300 gallons of water have been filtered. If you are unsure if your filter is due for replacement, another indicator is if the water flow from the dispenser has slowed down considerably. Replacing this part is a simple task that does not require any tools or shutting off the water or power supply to your fridge.

This OEM ice and water filter fits side-by-side and bottom-freezer GE models. The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it.","Pieces/units were broken from general wear-and-tear. | The Frame Cover I ordered had broken. 3rd time replacing it.

This is a French door hinge that is compatible with various models of refrigerators and is used to control the mullion (long plastic strips) on the inside portion of the French doors. If you notice that your doors open and the mullion either moves freely or is stuck, this hinge needs to be replaced immediately to prevent issues with frost buildup, energy efficiency and temperature fluctuations. Replacing this hinge is quite simple, and you will only need a flathead and Philips-head screwdriver to do it. First, remove the screw covers from the securing screws for the mullion. Unscrew and remove the securing screws with your Philips-head screwdriver, and then pull the mullion up and out carefully to dislodge it from the fridge door. Near the middle of the mullion, disconnect the wire harness to remove the mullion completely. Remove the hinge cover with a flathead screwdriver to expose the hinge, and then carefully remove and replace the old hinge onto its attaching spring. Then you can simply reassemble the rest of the door assembly, along with the hinge cover and wire harness.",,AP4141349,,,2-3 business days,In Stock Add to cart,https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/4143931-1-N-Samsung-DA61-03230B-Hinge.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxAnUxggv_Y,https://www.partselect.com/PS4143931-Samsung-DA61-03230B-Hinge.htm?SourceCode=18,30,2026-02-11 14:27:31.705733,2026-02-11 14:27:31.705733,"[{""model_number"": ""DFSF9VKBABB"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/DFSF9VKBABB/MFGModelNumber/0001/""}, {""model_number"": ""DFSF9VKBAWW"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/DFSF9VKBAWW/MFGModelNumber/0001/""}, {""model_number"": ""DFSS9VKBASS"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/DFSS9VKBASS/MFGModelNumber/0001/""}, {""model_number"": ""KF195ACEB"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/KF195ACEB/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""KF195ACEBXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/KF195ACEBXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""KF195ACEW"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/KF195ACEW/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""KF195ACRS"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/KF195ACRS/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""KF215ACEB"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/KF215ACEB/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""KF215ACEBXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/KF215ACEBXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""KF215ACEW"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/KF215ACEW/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""KF215ACEWXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/KF215ACEWXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""KF215ACRS"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/KF215ACRS/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""KF215ACRSXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/KF215ACRSXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""PFSF6PKXFWW"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/PFSF6PKXFWW/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ABBP"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ABBP/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ABBPXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ABBPXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ABRS"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ABRS/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ABRSXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ABRSXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ABWP"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ABWP/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ABWPXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ABWPXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ACBP"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ACBP/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ACBPXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ACBPXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ACRS"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ACRS/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ACRSXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ACRSXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ACWP"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ACWP/Manufacturer/74/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF195ACWPXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF195ACWPXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF197ABBP"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF197ABBP/MFGModelNumber/XAA-0000/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF197ABBP/XAA"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF197ABBP!2FXAA/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF197ABBPXAC"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF197ABBPXAC/""}, {""model_number"": ""RF197ABPN"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/RF197ABPN/MFGModelNumber/XAA-0000/""}]"

The nozzle assembly can be found at the bottom of the dishwasher tub.

This front plate assembly, also known as a mullion or flipper, is a genuine replacement part designed for select LG and Kenmore French-door refrigerators. It serves a critical function by sealing the gap between the doors, preventing cold air from escaping and helping maintain consistent internal temperatures. Constructed from durable plastic, it supports both the performance and appearance of the appliance. A failing mullion may result in poor sealing, visible gaps, increased energy consumption, and potential food spoilage.

The rack track stop on your dishwasher is designed to stop the dish rack at the appropriate place when opening and closing the rack. If your dishwasher is not cleaning your dishes properly, the rack stop may need to be replaced. The replacement part may differ slightly from the broken part, depending on the model. However, the different styles are interchangeable. This product is sold individually and comes in both a white and grey plastic version. Many of our customers found this repair to be very easy and takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Simply snap the old part out and snap the new part into place. You will not require any tools to complete the job.

This gray plastic lower dishrack roller is a part for your dishwasher. It attaches to the bottom of the lower dishrack, allowing it to move in and out smoothly. If the lower dishrack stops moving in and out easily or preventing you from being able to shut the dishwasher door, inspect the dishrack roller for damage. The assembly includes 2 rollers and the bracket that attaches to the dishrack (parts are not sold separately).

The Lower Spray Arm is used in your dishwasher to spray water and clean your dishes. If broken there will be visible damage or your dishes may no longer be cleaned properly. If your spray arm is broken (due to general wear or high heat), it should be replaced. Your lower spray arm will be located at the bottom of your dishwasher tub. Check your user manual and model number to ensure this model is right for you. This version is plastic and metal and comes in gray/blue. We recommend you wear work gloves to keep your hands safe when installing and disconnect power to the appliance. You will also want to make sure that you turn off the water supply to your dishwasher. From here, you will want to open the dishwasher, pull out the lower rack and set it aside. Remove the lower wash arm. On each side of the bottom of the spray arm, there are small locking tabs that can be pushed aside using a flathead screwdriver. Once released, the spray arm can easily be pulled off the dishwasher. Put the new lower wash arm in place and push it down to lock it in. Ensure it is spinning freely and does not hit the heating element. Return the lower dish rack into place and then close the dishwasher door.","Was not draining. Found blockage, tiny pc of plastic.

The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey. Includes one lower door gasket.","Water leaking from dishwasher Iwatche | NO PROBLEM, VERY EASY | Water leak from dishwasher. | Leaking water | The old gasket was leaking | water coming out around the middle of the bottom of the door | Our Frigidaire dishwasher leaked from the lower left side. | The bottom door gasket was loose and leakage was occurring from the door | Missing tub gasket | Broken BOTTOM door gasket",AP5809675 | 154297601 | 154297602 | 154297603 | 154576501 | 154588201 | 154759101,Easy,15 - 30 mins,2-3 business days,In Stock Add to cart,https://partselectcom-gtcdcddbene3cpes.z01.azurefd.net/9495545-1-N-Frigidaire-809006501-Dishwasher-Bottom-Door-Gasket.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NfdyJp1zKA,https://www.partselect.com/PS9495545-Frigidaire-809006501-Dishwasher-Bottom-Door-Gasket.htm?SourceCode=18,30,2026-02-11 14:27:31.72756,2026-02-11 14:27:31.72756,"[{""model_number"": ""58714000100"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714000100/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714000101"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714000101/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714000102"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714000102/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714001990"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714001990/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714001991"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714001991/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714001992"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714001992/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714001993"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714001993/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714002990"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714002990/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714002991"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714002991/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714002992"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714002992/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714002993"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714002993/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714003100"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714003100/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714008001"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714008001/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714008002"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714008002/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714008003"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714008003/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714009100"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714009100/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714009101"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714009101/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714009102"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714009102/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012400"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012400/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012401"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012401/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012402"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012402/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012403"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012403/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012404"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012404/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012405"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012405/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012406A"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012406A/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012407A"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012407A/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012408A"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012408A/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012409B"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012409B/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714012410B"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714012410B/""}, {""model_number"": ""58714013400"", ""model_url"": ""https://www.partselect.com/Models/58714013400/""}]"

This manufacturer-approved Rack Stop Clip is a gray plastic part which can be installed with a screwdriver. Measuring slightly over an inch in length, it prevents the rack from sliding too far and falling off. If broken or damaged, then the rack will slide too far and this is a sign the part should be replaced. It attaches to the end of the top dishwasher rack. This clip can be used for the left or right side, and is sold individually. It is a good idea to replace both sides at once. To make this repair, start by pulling out the rack, then, using your screwdriver, reach in behind the rack stops and press the clips in. You should be able to remove the stops from the track from here. Next, you should be able to slide the track back over the rollers and snap the new track stop into place.",TOP RACK  END CLIP BROKE OFF | End stop on the upper rack of the dishwasher | Top rack rail broken | Left side rack clip came off | Upper drawer rack stop clip broke caused one side  fell off rail. | Top rack rear stop broken | The rack stop clip on the upper right rail broke.

This water access valve, also known as a water inlet valve, is an authentic OEM replacement part used in dishwashers. The valve controls the flow of water into the dishwasher. It is responsible for allowing water from the household water supply to enter the dishwasher tub during the wash cycle. The valve is controlled by the electronic control board, which signals it to open or close based on the selected cycle and water level requirements. Once the dishwasher is filled to the appropriate level, the water inlet valve closes to prevent any further water from entering the tub. If the valve is faulty, you will likely experience water leakages, difficulties filling dishwasher, and poor cleaning results.

This wheel is a dishwasher rack wheel designed for the upper rack of your appliance. The roller wheel is approximately 1.25 inches in diameters and includes the brushing you need for installation. It simply clips right on to the rack frame. After the wheel are attached to the side of the dishrack and are placed into the slides on either side of the appliance. Dishrack roller wheels allow the upper rack in a dishwasher to glide in and out of the appliance with ease.

The dishwasher roller assembly connects to the dishrack, and is located in the lower level of the dishwasher. It allows the dishrack to easily slide in and out. If the lower rack keeps falling off the track in your dishwasher, makes noises, the door will not close, or the dishes are not getting clean, then it is best to replace it for more security. A flat blade screw driver is the only tool needed for this installation. Open the lower dishwasher rack and remove retaining tabs from both ends of the rack and slide it out. Locate the older roll assembly, remove it and replace the rollers. Remember to put the tabs on each side back before sliding it back in.

This is the lower dishrack assembly for various models of LG dishwashers. This dishrack is an OEM part that is designed to hold dishes and cutlery during the wash cycle of the dishwasher. This dishrack is made of a coated metal to prevent rusting, cracking, and peeling. However, over time and through further exposure to hot temperatures from the heating element, the coated material of the dishwasher rack can begin to peel, at which time it needs replacing.

This dishwasher door gasket is designed to form a secure, watertight seal around the tub, preventing leaks and enhancing overall wash efficiency. Constructed from flexible, heat-resistant black rubber, it withstands temperatures up to 150°F and resists wear over time. By maintaining a tight seal, the gasket ensures that water and steam remain contained within the dishwasher during operation, contributing to more effective cleaning cycles and reduced energy waste. A worn or damaged gasket can lead to water pooling, inefficient washing, and potential damage to surrounding cabinetry. Replacing it restores proper function and helps extend the appliance’s lifespan.
