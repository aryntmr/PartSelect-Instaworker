This normally is a mechanically controlled baffle or flapper that controls the amount of cold air entering the fresh food compartment. If the baffle is damaged or the linkage to the control knob is damaged, then you may not have enough cold air entering the fresh food compartment resulting in higher than normal temperatures.\nHow to inspect a refrigerator’s air inlet damper or baffle:\n\nDisconnect your refrigerator from the power source and open your refrigerator door to locate the damper or baffle. It will be found where the cold air enters the fresh food compartment.\n The housing that the baffle or damper is encased in is often made of plastic with a Styrofoam lining and may have a foam seal to prevent air leakage. Care should be used when inspecting the housing to avoid damage to the seal or the Styrofoam.\n Some refrigerator models use a temperature sensing bulb attached to this control that will automatically adjust the control for changes in the interior temperature. Make sure that the sensing bulb is in the correct position and is not damaged.\nAttempt to operate the control knob to verify that the linkage is intact and that it moves freely.\nIf the damper/baffle is stuck in the closed or nearly closed position or does not move freely, then you need a replacement air inlet damper or baffle.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Refrigerator Parts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nMore Repair Parts\nStill not sure which part is broken?

Most manufacturers recommend replacing the filter every 6 months, but local water conditions may require that you replace more frequently.\nHow to inspect your refrigerator’s ice and water filter:\n\nDetermine when you last replaced your water filter. Replacement frequency varies by model and local water quality, but you should never go longer than 12 months without replacing your water filter.\nLocate your water filter. Location varies by model and brand, but it is often found inside the unit attached to the ceiling or back corner, behind the base grill, or in the water line leading to the fridge. If your filter is in the water line, you will need to turn off the water supply before removing the filter.\nDue to the variety of filters and placements we suggest you follow brand specific install instructions or refer to manufacturer guidelines.

You should also inspect the motor for any signs of wear or damage.\nIf you cannot turn it easily, or if it is noticeably worn, you need a replacement evaporator fan motor.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Refrigerator Motors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nElectronic Control Board\n\n\nSome newer models of refrigerators may use an electronic control board. Thermistors or temperature sensors are connected to the control board and are used to monitor temperatures in the fresh food and freezer compartments. The control board uses this information to control the operation of the compressor, fan motors and defrost system. If the temperatures are too warm, then the electronic control could be at fault. Electronic controls are complex and expensive and usually reliable, so you should first verify that all of the other components such as the compressor, fans and sensors are operating properly before condemning the control. Some manufacturers may provide specific information that will help in diagnosing a defective control.\nHow to inspect your refrigerator’s electronic control board:\n\nUnplug your fridge before beginning as you will be handling electrical components.\nLocate and remove the electronic control board from your appliance.

It will usually be found in the fresh food compartment, behind a vent found on the top or side of the fridge.\nRemove the vent and inspect the damper flap for any signs of wear or damage, attempt to manually move the flap. You should feel little or no resistance.\nIf you find any issues when performing the above checks, you will need a replacement air damper or freezer control. If you do not find the issue, suspect the evaporator coils or motor.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Refrigerator Parts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nTemperature Sensor Or Thermistor\n\n\nIn models that use an Electronic Control, a thermistor or temperature sensor may be used to monitor fresh food and freezer temperatures. The control board uses this information to turn on the compressor and fan circuits as well as to operate the damper control on some models. If the sensor becomes damaged or defective it may incorrectly signal the control board to close the air damper too much and result in colder than normal freezer temperatures. Individual manufacturers may have specific information available to test these sensors, depending on the model involved, and may also provide a fault code on the electronic control board on some models.\nHow to test a refrigerator temperature sensor or thermistor with a multi-meter:\n\nDisconnect your refrigerator from the power source and then remove the back panel of your refrigerator to locate the main control board.\nLocate and remove the thermistor(s), they will be attached to the main control board.\nPlace the thermistor(s) in ice water for 5 minutes before testing. The amount of resistance in a thermistor varies based on what their surface temperature is when they are measured. The range below only applies to thermistors measured at 32 degrees F.\nUsing a multi-meter on Rx1 mode, touch the terminals with the meter’s probes. The test should produce a reading of 16,600 ohms (+/- 5 percent).\nIf you receive a reading outside this range, you will need a replacement temperature sensor or thermistor.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Refrigerator Sensors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\n\nMore Repair Parts\nStill not sure which part is broken?

The door latch assembly is used to hold the door closed during the cycle to prevent water from leaking and it also incorporates the door latch switches that supply power to the dishwasher controls. If the door cannot close properly to activate the door latch switches or if the switches are defective, then the dishwasher controls will not receive power and the dishwasher will not start. Inspect the latch assembly including the switches.\nHow to test a dishwasher door latch assembly with a multimeter:\n\nDisconnect your appliance from the power source before beginning.\nBegin by removing the inner door panel to gain access to the door latch assembly. It is usually found at the top of the door. Once you have located it, verify that the door catch activates the door latch switches by inserting the catch into the assembly.\nIf the switches are being activated mechanically, remove the switches to check them for continuity.

The first step of the dishwasher cycle is normally a drain function to remove any standing water in the tub. If you do not hear the drain pump motor running, then you should look at the timer or electronic control as a possible cause. On manual timer models, the timer is used to supply power to the pump motor, water inlet valve, heater circuit and drain pump motor at the proper sequence in the cycle. The timer uses a series of electrical contacts that are driven by a small motor all of which are encased in the timer housing.\nHow to test a dishwasher timer with a multimeter:\n\nDisconnect your appliance from the power source.\nLocate and remove the timer. It will most likely be found in the control panel, but it is also often found behind the lower kick plate.\nSome timers may have multiple sets of contacts/wires, if this is true for your model, you will need to refer to your wiring diagram to determine which contacts to test.\nSet your multimeter to Rx1000 and touch the contacts with the probes.

Depending on the model involved, the switch may be used in the motor or fill circuit and could cause a dishwasher to not start if it were defective or if the selector buttons were not fully depressed. Check to ensure that the switch is properly depressed before attempting any disassembly. The contacts of the selector switch can be checked for continuity with a multimeter using the schematic diagram as a guide.\nHow to test a dishwasher selector switch with a multimeter:\n\nBegin by disconnecting your appliance from the power source.\nRemove the inner door panel of your dishwasher in order to locate the selector switch. It most likely will be found on the control panel. Once you have located it, ensure that the switch is properly depressed. If it is, remove it from the appliance in order to test it.\nUsing a multimeter set to Rx1, touch the probes to the terminals of the switch, you will need to test each button individually. This should produce a reading of infinity. Next, with the probes still on the terminals, press in on the",

If your dishwasher does not fill, then you should first check the inlet supply to verify that you have enough water pressure.\nHow to inspect a dishwasher water inlet valve:\n\nUnplug your dishwasher and disconnect the water supply before starting.\nLocate your water inlet valve. It is commonly found on the lower left side of your dishwasher. You likely will need to remove the lower access panel to locate it.\nLooking for any signs of damage, wear, or cracking, visually inspect the water inlet valve.\nIf your valve shows signs of any of the symptoms described above, you will need a replacement water inlet valve.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Dishwasher Valves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\n\n\n\nHow to test a water inlet valveHow to replace a water inlet valve\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nFloat\n\n\nA malfunctioning float could cause the dishwasher to not fill with water. The acts as a safety device that prevents the dishwasher from overfilling with water. The float rises with the water level in the dishwasher and when the proper level is reached, the float will trigger the float switch to turn off the water inlet valve.\nHow to check a dishwasher float assembly:\n\nBefore beginning, verify that you have unplugged your appliance.\nBegin by opening your dishwasher door and removing the cover over the float assembly. Once you’ve done that, manually lift the float and let it drop multiple times, it should move freely, if it does not, remove the float to remove any foreign objects in the guide tube. You should also inspect the float for any visible wear or damage.\nRemove the lower access panel to determine if the float is mechanically engaging with the float switch.\nIf you find any issues while performing this inspection, you will need a replacement float.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Dishwasher Parts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\n\n\n\nHow to check the floatHow to replace the float\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nFloat Switch\n\n\nWhen the float switch is triggered by the float, power to the water inlet valve is interrupted and it stops the flow of water into the dishwasher.\nHow to test a dishwasher float switch with a multimeter:\n\nDisconnect your dishwasher from the power source before beginning this inspection; you will be handling electrical components.\nLocate and remove the float switch. It will be found behind the lower access panel, sitting directly below the float assembly. Use caution when disconnecting the wires from the switch, do not pull directly on the wires.\nOnce you have removed it, test the float switch by setting your multimeter to Rx1 and touching the probes to the switch’s terminals. This should produce a reading of zero or infinity. With the probes still touching the terminals, press in on the switch’s button, this should change the reading to the opposite extreme (from zero to infinity or infinity to zero).\nIf your test results produce readings that differ from the above, you will need a replacement float switch.\n\n\n\n\n\nStart Your Repair Here\nView All Dishwasher Switches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nNeed help finding your model number?\n\n\n\n\nHow to test a float switchHow to replace a float switch\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to Top\n\n\nDoor Switch\n\n\nThe door switch is a simple on/off mechanism that prohibits the dishwasher from operating when the door is open. If the door switch or switches are malfunctioning the dishwasher will not fill with water.\nHow to test a dishwasher door switch with a multimeter:\n\nBefore beginning, ensure that you unplug your appliance as you will be working with electrical components.\nThe door switch is typically located behind the door panel at the top of the door. You will need to separate the inner door from the outer door in order to access the switch. Once you have located it, remove the door switch in order to test it for continuity.\nUsing a multimeter set to Rx1, test for continuity by touching one probe to the COM terminal and the other probe to the N.O. Terminal. With the actuator NOT pushed in, your reading should be infinity. Next, keeping the probes on the terminals, press in on the actuato",
