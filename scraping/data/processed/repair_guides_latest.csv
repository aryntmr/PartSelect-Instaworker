Door Gaskets Or Seals


Door gaskets or seals are found along the outside of the refrigerator’s doors. They are normally made from a vinyl material and will typically have a flexible magnetic strip inside to adhere to the cabinet when the door is closed to create an airtight seal. If there is moisture along the edge of the door then inspect the gaskets for distortion or damage. Air leakage through a defective gasket will create excessive moisture in the refrigerator, possibly resulting in defrost issues and potential water leaks.
How to inspect refrigerator door gaskets or seals:

After unplugging your refrigerator, open the fridge and freezer doors to inspect the door gaskets or seals.
You are looking for any discoloration, mold, wear, missing pieces, or anything else that may prevent a proper seal.
If you find any of the above, you will need replacement gaskets or seals.

Water Inlet Valve


The water inlet valve is a solenoid-operated device that connects your household water supply line to your refrigerator if you have an ice maker or water dispenser. When activated, it diverts water from the supply line to the dispenser or to fill your ice maker.
How to check the water inlet valve in a refrigerator with a multi-meter:

Unplug your refrigerator, disconnect the water supply and locate your water inlet valve. It is usually on the rear of the fridge, near the bottom. You will need to remove the rear panel to access it.
Inspect the valve inlet supply connections for leaks and tighten or replace the connectors. You should also inspect the valve body for any cracks or damage. Check the outlet tubing for cracks or abrasions that may also create a leak and replace any cracked or brittle tubing and connectors.
If none of the above appear to be the cause of the leak, remove the water inlet valve from the unit.
Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, test your valve for conitniuty by placing the probes on the valve’s terminals. You should receive a reading of 200 to 500 ohms.
If you receive any other reading, you need a replacement water inlet valve.

Ice Maker Assembly


If your fridge is leaking water from in or around the ice maker, you’re probably also experiencing problems with the ice distribution itself. The cubes may be too small, one solid block of ice or not being produced at all. Inspect the ice maker mold to see if there are ice cubes present. If there are no cubes or very small cubes, then you should look for issues with the water fill system.
How to inspect a refrigerator’s ice maker assembly:

Disconnect your appliance from both the power source and water source.
Inspect the fill tube and the fill cup area at the back of the icemaker to make sure that they are not frozen. If there is an ice buildup in that area, confirm no foreign objects have disrupted the flow of water into the fill cup.
 Inspect the outlet tubing from the fill valve to the ice maker fill tube for any signs of restrictions.
If any issues are found while performing the checks above, you will may a replacement ice maker assembly. If nothing obvious has caused the ice buildup, then suspect the inlet valve or tubing.

Overload Or Relay-Start Capacitor


The overload relay is a protection device used in the compressor circuit on your refrigerator. Power is applied to the compressor motor windings through the overload device, and the relay is used to add the start winding in the circuit until the compressor is at running speed. If the fans are running and your compressor won’t start or if you hear a clicking sound from the unit, check the overload relay for signs of overheating or arcing.
How to test a refrigerator’s overload or relay-start capacitor with a multi-meter:

Begin by ensuring you have unplugged your refrigerator, and then remove the rear panel.
Locate and remove your overload or relay-start capacitor. On modern refrigerators the overload relay is usually a combined part and plugs directly onto the side of the compressor. There may also be a start capacitor attached to the relay overload assembly, which provides increased starting voltage to the compressor windings.
To test, begin by discharging the capacitor, then set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and place the probes onto the terminals of the overload capacitor and/or the relay-start capacitor. The reading you should receive will vary from model to model, and may be indicated on the outside of the capacitor, or in your owner’s manual.
If your test does not produce the reading the manufacturer recommends, you need a replacement overload or relay-start capacitor. If your tests do produce the recommended readings you may have a defective compressor, which will need to be tested by a qualified professional as it is a live circuit test.

Cold Control & Temperature Control


The cold control is a temperature-controlled switch that supplies power to the compressor and fan circuits in the refrigerator. If your refrigerator won’t start and no fans are running, then you may have a defective control.
How to test your fridge’s cold control & temperature control with a multi-meter:

After disconnecting your appliance from the power source, open your refrigerator door and locate the control. It will be located behind the temperature adjustment knob and is usually found in the fresh food section control panel.
Remove the control from the fridge in order to test it.
Using a multi-meter on the Rx1 setting, set your control to the lowest (warmest) setting, and place the probes on the terminals. You are testing for continuity and you should receive a reading of infinity.
With the probes still on the terminals, adjust the control to higher (colder) and higher settings, your reading should then change to zero, indicating that you have continuity.
If your control fails either of the tests above, you will need a replacement cold control & temperature control.

Electronic Control Board


Some newer refrigerators are controlled by an Electronic Control Board that monitors temperatures and controls the compressor, fans and defrost system. If your refrigerator will not start, the control board could be at fault. Electronic controls are complex and expensive. You should first verify that there is no power being supplied to the compressor, that you have incoming power to the control board and that the external controls are functioning properly before condemning the electronic control.
How to inspect your refrigerator’s electronic control board:

Ensure that you have disconnected your appliance from the power before beginning as you will be handling electrical components.
Open your refrigerator door to locate and remove the electronic control board from your appliance. It will be located inside the control box, which is usually found attached to the top or side of the fridge.
Look on the control board for signs of arcing, burnt connections, damaged foil, wear, or any other damage.
If you find any of the above, you need a replacement electronic control board.

Ice & Water Filter


If so equipped, the ice and water filter in your refrigerator is responsible for removing any debris or contaminants from your water that may remain after local water treatment. Most filters contain and are made up of carbon and a fabric filter. Over time the filter may become restricted and reduce or stop the water flow to the dispenser. Most manufacturers recommend replacing the filter every 6 months, but local water conditions may require that you replace more frequently.
How to inspect your refrigerator’s ice and water filter:

Consider when you last changed your ice and water filter. How frequently you need to change your filter varies by model and local water conditions, but you should never exceed 12 months of use per filter.
Find and remove your water filter. The exact location differs from model to model, but it is commonly located in the water line leading to the fridge, behind the base grill, or inside the unit attached to the rear corner or ceiling. If your filter is in the water line, you will need to disconnect the water supply before beginning.
With the variety of locations and removal instructions, we recommend you follow brand specific directions, or refer to your owner’s manual for specific directions. Take note of the installation date on your calendar before installing the new filter.
If your filter is damaged or clogged, or if you have exceeded the manufacturers’ recommended guidelines, you will need a replacement ice and water filter.

Water Inlet Valve


The water inlet valve is a solenoid-operated device that supplies water to the dispenser when activated. When water is selected at the dispenser control panel, line voltage is supplied to the solenoid of the water inlet valve to allow water to flow. Verify that you have adequate pressure at the inlet to the valve, that the inlet screen is not plugged and that there are no restrictions in the inlet or outlet tubing.
How to test your refrigerator’s water inlet valve with a multi-meter:

After disconnecting the water supply and unplugging your refrigerator, remove the rear access panel and locate the water inlet valve. It is usually found near the bottom of the fridge.
Begin by inspecting all the tubing, and their respective connections, for leaks, damage, wear, abrasions, or brittle tubing.
If you do not locate the source of the leak in the above checks, remove the water inlet valve to test it.
With a multi-meter in Rx1 mode, touch the terminals with the probes to test for continuity. A functional water inlet valve should put off a reading of 200 to 500 ohms. 
If you receive any other reading, you need a replacement water inlet valve.

Air Inlet Damper Or Baffle


The air damper, baffle or diffuser is the device that balances the air flow from the evaporator fan housing. This normally is a mechanically controlled baffle or flapper that controls the amount of cold air entering the fresh food compartment. If the baffle is damaged or the linkage to the control knob is damaged, then you may not have enough cold air entering the fresh food compartment resulting in higher than normal temperatures.
How to inspect a refrigerator’s air inlet damper or baffle:

Disconnect your refrigerator from the power source and open your refrigerator door to locate the damper or baffle. It will be found where the cold air enters the fresh food compartment.
 The housing that the baffle or damper is encased in is often made of plastic with a Styrofoam lining and may have a foam seal to prevent air leakage. Care should be used when inspecting the housing to avoid damage to the seal or the Styrofoam.
 Some refrigerator models use a temperature sensing bulb attached to this control that will automatically adjust the control for changes in the interior temperature. Make sure that the sensing bulb is in the correct position and is not damaged.
Attempt to operate the control knob to verify that the linkage is intact and that it moves freely.
If the damper/baffle is stuck in the closed or nearly closed position or does not move freely, then you need a replacement air inlet damper or baffle.

Water Fill Tubes


Inspect the ice maker mold to see if there are ice cubes present. If there are no cubes or very small cubes, then you should look for issues with the water fill system.
How to inspect your refrigerator’s water fill tubes:

Before beginning, disconnect both the power and water source from your refrigerator.
At the back of the icemaker, inspect the fill tube and the fill cup area at the back of the ice maker to make sure that they are not frozen. If there is an ice buildup in that area, confirm no foreign objects have disrupted the flow of water into the fill cup.
 Inspect the outlet tubing from the fill valve to the ice maker fill tube for any signs of restrictions.
If you find any issues while performing the checks above, you will need replacement water fill tubes.

Water Inlet Valve


Some water inlet valves may have a screen to filter debris before it can enter the valve. If the screen is plugged, water flow will be restricted, and the result will be small or layered ice cubes. Remove and clean the screen if it is clogged. If dirt has gotten into the valve it may not shut off completely and will continuously drip water into the ice maker fill tube and will eventually freeze up. Low household water pressure or a restriction at the manual shut off valve will also cause the water inlet valve to not shut off completely and create this same condition. Self piercing saddle valves are the most common shut off valve to cause this problem as the hole that is pierced in the water line is often too small and will more easily become restricted.
How to check the water inlet valve in a refrigerator with a multi-meter:

Disconnect your appliance from the power and water source before beginning.
Remove the rear access panel and locate your water inlet valve, it is usually found near the bottom.
Before removing the inlet valve, look for any signs of leaks or loose connectors in the valve inlet supply. If no issues are found, inspect the valve body for any cracks or damage.
Inspect the outlet tubing for any brittle tubing, abrasions, cracks, or any other damage.
If you do not locate any leaks, disconnect the water inlet valve and remove it from the refrigerator to test it
Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the terminals with the probes. You are testing for continuity and should receive a reading of 200 to 500 ohms.
If you receive any other reading, you need a replacement water inlet valve.

Ice & Water Filter


If equipped, the Ice and Water filter in your refrigerator is responsible for removing any debris or contaminants from your water that may remain after local water treatment. Most filters contain and are made up of carbon and fabric filter. Over time, the filter may become restricted and reduce the water flow to the ice maker, causing a symptom of little or no ice. Most manufacturers recommend replacing the filter every 6 months, but local water conditions may require that you replace more frequently.
How to inspect your refrigerator’s ice and water filter:

Determine when you last replaced your water filter. Replacement frequency varies by model and local water quality, but you should never go longer than 12 months without replacing your water filter.
Locate your water filter. Location varies by model and brand, but it is often found inside the unit attached to the ceiling or back corner, behind the base grill, or in the water line leading to the fridge. If your filter is in the water line, you will need to turn off the water supply before removing the filter.
Due to the variety of filters and placements we suggest you follow brand specific install instructions or refer to manufacturer guidelines. Before installing the new filter note the install date on the filter or on your calendar.
If it has been longer than the manufacturer recommended guidelines, or you filter is damaged, you will need a replacement ice and water filter.

Fresh Food & Freezer Door Gasket


Leaky or damaged door seals can create excess moisture that is visible near the air outlet ducts or on shelves in the freezer. Damaged gaskets can also prevent doors from closing properly and may introduce enough moisture into the refrigerator that defrost issues may occur. Moisture along the edge of the door is a good indication that the gaskets are not sealing properly and should be replaced.
How to inspect refrigerator door gaskets:

Take a piece of paper, and place it at various points along the door.
Close the door normally and slide the paper out.
If the paper slides out without any resistance, then you will need replacement fresh food & freezer door gasket(s).

Dispenser Door Assembly or Flapper & Ice Door Kit


When activated, the ice dispenser door opens so that ice can be dispensed from the icemaker. The door or flapper is normally spring loaded and will have a vinyl or foam rubber seal attached to prevent room air from entering the refrigerator. If there is moisture around the front of the dispenser or if there is signs of moisture in the ice bin area, then this would indicate that the door is not closing completely. The flapper door is hinged and is normally operated by a solenoid with a return spring and often with a damper to slow the closing action to prevent the door from closing on an ice cube.
How to inspect a refrigerator dispenser door assembly or flapper & ice door kit:

Remove the dispenser cover in order to inspect its components.
You should inspect the following parts for damage or wear.

Door hinges.
Door seal.
Door pivot mechanism.
Return spring.
Solenoid plunger and linkage.
Damper.

If you find any issues while checking the above parts, you may need a replacement dispenser door assembly or flapper & ice door kit.

Door Closure Cam Kit


In some models of side-by-side refrigerators, closer cams on the lower door hinges are used to assist in closing the doors. The cams are made of hard plastic or nylon and have sloped shoulders on them that mate together. One cam is mounted to the bottom of the door and the other is mounted to the top of the hinge. When the door is opened, the door cam rotates up out of the hinge cam, lifting the door up and a detent allows it to stay in an open position. When closing the door, the weight of the door forces the door to pivot closed as the cams mate together. If either of these cams is broken, then the door may not close tightly. This would allow warm outside air to enter the refrigerator and cause condensation to form.
How to inspect your refrigerator’s door closure cam kit:

Open your refrigerator door and locate the closer cams.
Visually inspect the closer cams to verify that they are not cracked, worn, or otherwise damaged.
If they are damaged, you will need a replacement closure cam kit.

Door Hinge & Bearing


Fresh food and freezer doors rotate on hinges. The hinges act as bearings and the doors should pivot easily on them. If the hinges become worn or dry of lubricant, they may prevent the doors from closing completely. This could allow room air into the refrigerator and cause moisture problems. A common symptom of a faulty hinge bearing is when opening or closing the door a thumping and/or scraping noise can be heard.
How to check your refrigerator’s door hinge & bearings:

Open and remove your refrigerator door in order to locate the hinge & bearing.
Inspect the hinges for any signs of cracking or damage. If they are not damaged, lubricate the hinges with a food safe grease to see if that resolves the issue.
If they are damaged or greasing the hinges does not solve the issue, you need replacement door hinges & bearings.

Cold Control Or Temperature Control


The cold control is a temperature-controlled switch that supplies power to the compressor and fan circuits in the refrigerator. If the compressor and fans are operating normally but not running often enough or long enough to maintain the correct temperatures in the fresh food and freezer sections, then the cold control may be defective or out of calibration. Normal fresh food temperatures are in the 38° Fahrenheit range with the control set to mid-point. Verify that the capillary tube or sensing bulb is not damaged or out of position and that the wire terminals are not loose or corroded.
How to test your fridge’s cold control & temperature control with a multi-meter:

Unplug your refrigerator before beginning, then open your refrigerator door and locate the control. It will be located behind the temperature adjustment knob and is usually found in the fresh food section control panel.
After removing the control from the appliance, turn the control to the warmest setting, set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the probes to the terminals
 You are testing for continuity and you should receive a reading of infinity. With the probes still touching the terminals, adjust the control to higher (colder) and higher settings. Your reading should change to zero, indicating that you have continuity.
If your control fails either of the tests above, you will need a replacement cold control & temperature control.

Evaporator Fan Motor


The evaporator fan motor is used to circulate the cold air throughout the refrigerator when the compressor is running. If the fan is defective, then temperatures in the freezer section will rise slowly and temperatures in the fresh food section will rise more rapidly and the compressor will run longer and more frequently than normal. With the compressor running you should also hear the evaporator fan running at the same time, as well as the condenser fan which is located next to the compressor.
How to inspect a refrigerator evaporator fan motor:

Disconnect your refrigerator from the power source and remove the evaporator fan cover, which will be found in the freezer compartment.
The motor shaft should turn freely with minimal resistance, attempt to turn the shaft manually to check for any resistance.
If there is a significant amount of ice on the motor, defrost your freezer and see if that resolves the issue. You should also inspect the motor for any signs of wear or damage.
If you cannot turn it easily, or if it is noticeably worn, you need a replacement evaporator fan motor.

Electronic Control Board


Some newer models of refrigerators may use an electronic control board. Thermistors or temperature sensors are connected to the control board and are used to monitor temperatures in the fresh food and freezer compartments. The control board uses this information to control the operation of the compressor, fan motors and defrost system. If the temperatures are too warm, then the electronic control could be at fault. Electronic controls are complex and expensive and usually reliable, so you should first verify that all of the other components such as the compressor, fans and sensors are operating properly before condemning the control. Some manufacturers may provide specific information that will help in diagnosing a defective control.
How to inspect your refrigerator’s electronic control board:

Unplug your fridge before beginning as you will be handling electrical components.
Locate and remove the electronic control board from your appliance. It is inside of the refrigerator, inside of the control box, which is usually found attached to the top or side of the fridge.
Inspect your control board for any signs of damaged foil, wear, burnt connections, arcing, or any other damage.

Air Inlet Damper Or Baffle


The air damper, baffle or diffuser is the device that balances the air flow from the evaporator fan housing. This normally is a mechanically controlled baffle or flapper that controls the amount of cold air entering the fresh food compartment. If the baffle is damaged or the linkage to the control knob is damaged, then too much cold air may enter the fresh food compartment resulting in lower than normal temperatures. The baffle or damper will be located where the cold air enters the fresh food compartment. The housing that the baffle or damper is encased in is often made of plastic with a Styrofoam lining and may have a foam seal to prevent air leakage.
How to inspect a refrigerator’s air inlet damper or baffle:

Unplug your refrigerator and locate the damper or baffle. It is usually found where the cold air enters the fresh food compartment.
Use caution when inspecting the baffle or damper to not damage the plastic & Styrofoam housing that the baffle or damper is encased in.
If your model of has a temperature sensing bulb attached to this control make sure that the sensing bulb is in the correct position and not damaged.
The control knob should move freely, try to move it to verify that the linkage is intact and that it moves freely.
If the damper/baffle is stuck in the closed or nearly closed position or does not move freely, then you need a replacement air inlet damper or baffle.

Temperature Sensor Or Thermistor


Some electronic controls models will use a thermistor to sense the temperature. The electronic control monitors this temperature and will automatically adjust the damper. The temperature sensor is normally a plastic encased capsule with two wires attached and may be located near the air inlet. The thermistor will have a specific resistance based on temperature and is therefore difficult to diagnose without the manufacturer’s specifications. Some models may indicate a fault code when the sensor is faulty.
How to test a refrigerator temperature sensor or thermistor with a multi-meter:

Verify that you have disconnected your appliance from the power source as you will be inspecting electrical components.
The thermistor(s) will be connected to the main control board, you will need to remove the back panel of your fridge to access the control board. Remove the thermistor(s) from the appliance in order to test them.
Thermistor(s) will produce different multi-meter readings based on their temperature when you test them. The ranges below only apply to thermistors at 32 degrees F. Before testing them, you will need to place the thermistor(s) in ice water for 5 minutes to bring the temperature to 32 degrees F.
Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch the probes to the terminals, you should receive a reading of 16,600 ohms (+/- 5 percent).
If you receive a reading outside this range, you will need a replacement temperature sensor or thermistor.

Main Control Board


Some newer models may have an electronic control board that controls all of the refrigerators functions. Sensors are connected to the board that monitor fresh food and freezer compartment temperatures and the control board will use that information to operate the compressor and fans as well as the defrost system and in some cases the air baffle/damper to balance temperatures. A defective control board could cause a symptom of the fresh food compartment being too cold, but you should first eliminate the sensors and the damper before changing the control. Some manufacturers may provide detailed information on the procedure for testing the board and the sensors.
How to inspect a refrigerator’s main control board:

Disconnect your refrigerator from the power source, you will be inspecting electrical components.
The main control board is usually found inside the control box, which is inside the fridge, attached to the top or side of the fridge. Locate and remove the main control board from your appliance.
Looking for any signs of damaged foil, wear, burnt connections, arcing, or any other damage, inspect your main control board.

Defrost Timer


The defrost timer can be either a mechanical timer or an electronic ""adaptive defrost control"". Both are used to initiate the defrost cycle by turning on the defrost heater at specific intervals and for a specific amount of time. Mechanical timers are more common and usually activate a defrost cycle every 8-10 hours of compressor run time. This normally occurs about once every day or two. The defrost cycle will normally terminate after 20 to 30 minutes and the compressor and fans will start again. Adaptive defrost controls will monitor ambient conditions and previous defrost cycles and adapt the defrost cycle frequency and length to be more efficient.
How to test a refrigerator defrost timer with a multi-meter:

Unplug your refrigerator before beginning.
Locate & remove the defrost timer from the appliance in order to test it. It can be found behind the refrigerator's lower kickplate, in the refrigerator's control panel, or even behind the refrigerator on its back wall.
Set your multi-meter to the Rx1 setting and touch one probe to the common terminal (it should be labeled ""3"" or ""C""). One at a time, touch the other lead to the other three remaining terminals. Testing the first pair should produce a reading of zero, or near zero, denoting continuity. The second pair may also result in a reading of zero or near zero. Testing the third pair of terminals should produce a reading of infinity.
If you receive different readings, you will need a replacement defrost timer.

Defrost Heater


The defrost heater is controlled by the defrost timer or adaptive defrost control and the defrost termination thermostat. The heater is normally a glass encased heater wire with well insulated wire leads.
How to test a refrigerator defrost heater with a multi-meter:

Unplug your refrigerator before starting, you will be inspecting electrical components.
Remove your defrost heater. Defrost heaters are commonly located beneath a refrigerator's evaporator coils. You will have to remove any objects that are in your way such as shelves, icemaker parts, and the inside rear, back, or bottom panel(s). The defrost heater will have two wires connected to it, carefully grasp the metal connectors to remove them, do not pull the wires themselves.
With your multi-meter set onto Rx1 mode, place the probes onto the terminals of the defrost heater. You are testing for continuity and you should receive a reading between zero and infinity.
If you receive a reading of zero or infinity, you will need a replacement defrost heater.

Defrost Termination Thermostat


The defrost termination thermostat is used as a safety device to turn off the defrost heater when the temperature reaches a specific limit. The thermostat is normally wired in series with the defrost element and is normally open circuit above 35°- 47° Fahrenheit. For this reason it is sometimes difficult to check the continuity of the thermostat unless you are sure that the temperature is low enough to close the circuit. Newer style thermostats may have an internal bias resistor to aid in testing both the thermostat and the heater. The wiring diagram will normally indicate this.
How to test a refrigerator’s defrost thermostat with a multi-meter:

Because you will be testing electrical components, ensure you have disconnected your appliance from the power source before beginning.
 Locate and remove the defrost thermostat in order to test it. In freezer-on-top models, it may be located under the floor of the unit, or it could be found at the back of the freezer. If you have a side-by-side refrigerator, the defrost thermostat is found at the back of the freezer side. You will have to remove any objects that are in your way, such as the contents of the freezer, freezer shelves, icemaker parts, and t",2026-02-11T19:36:19.198943

Air Damper Or Freezer Control


If the freezer section is too cold and the fresh food section temperature is normal you should suspect that the air damper or freezer control is adjusted improperly or may be defective, and is deflecting more than the normal amount of air into the freezer section and not enough into the fresh food compartment to satisfy the cold control and turn off the compressor. 
How to inspect a refrigerator’s air damper or freezer control:

Unplug your refrigerator before beginning.
Locate your air damper or freezer control. It will usually be found in the fresh food compartment, behind a vent found on the top or side of the fridge.
Remove the vent and inspect the damper flap for any signs of wear or damage, attempt to manually move the flap. You should feel little or no resistance.
If you find any issues when performing the above checks, you will need a replacement air damper or freezer control. If you do not find the issue, suspect the evaporator coils or motor.

Pump


A defective pump and/or pump seal may be the cause of a dishwasher leak. The function of the pump is to circulate water in the dishwasher and in some models, to drain the water as well. The pump typically consists of two separate compartments; one for wash or circulation and the other for draining. The circulation part of the pump will typically consist of the wash impeller and the filter components while the drain portion will consist of a drain impeller and a chopper blade or in some cases, a solenoid operated diverter.
How to test a dishwasher pump with a multimeter:

Disconnect the power from your appliance before beginning.
On most models, the pump will be found behind the lower access panel. Locate and remove your dishwasher pump in order to test it.
To test for continuity, set your multimeter to Rx1 and touch the terminals with the probes. This test should produce a reading of exactly or nearly zero. You should also check the ground connection of the pump. To do this, leave one probe on the terminal and touch the other to the bare metal housing of the pump. This test should not produce any reading.
If your readings differ from the results above, you will need a replacement pump.

Door Gasket


If water appears to be leaking around the front of the dishwasher, the problem may be with the door gasket. The dishwasher door gasket or seal is normally made of soft rubber or vinyl and goes around the door or tub opening of the dishwasher, creating a watertight seal. Some dishwasher models have rubber baffles located at the bottom corners of the tub opening that prevent water leaking in that area. When vinyl or rubber ages, it can become less flexible or even brittle and may damage easily or not seal properly.
How to inspect a door gasket on a dishwasher:

Open your dishwasher door to locate the door gasket, and baffles if applicable.
Visually inspect the gasket for any signs of wearing, damage, missing pieces, or misalignment.
If you find any of the above, you will need a replacement door gasket.

Water Inlet Valve


The water inlet valve feeds the water from your home’s main water line into the dishwasher and could be the source of a leak. The inlet valve can be found behind the lower kick plate. The hot water inlet supply to the valve may be copper tubing, rubber hose or braided hose.
How to test a dishwasher water inlet valve:

Similar to most other inspections, begin by disconnecting your appliance from both the power and the water source.
In order to access the water inlet valve, you will need to remove the lower access panel of your appliance. The valve will likely be located on the left side.
Begin by inspecting the body of the valve. You are looking for any signs of cracking, damage, wear, or any other indication of a leak.
If you find any of the above, you will need a replacement water inlet valve.

Dispensers & Grommets


The detergent dispenser and the rinse aid dispenser are normally located on the inner door panel of the dishwasher. Some models use a dispenser assembly that is attached to the panel with screws and a gasket to seal against water leaks. Other models may use a dispenser that is molded into the door panel but uses a dispenser latch assembly that is attached to the back of the inner panel and use a rubber grommet to seal around the dispenser latch where it protrudes through the door panel. If you have a water leak that appears to come from the front of your dishwasher, the dispenser gasket or the dispenser latch grommet may be the cause.
How to inspect a dishwasher detergent/rinse aid dispenser & grommets:

For safety, unplug your dishwasher before beginning.
Open the dishwasher door to visually inspect the dispenser.

Door Latch Or Door Latch Switch


If your dishwasher won’t start, the problem could be the door latch or door latch switches. The door latch assembly is used to hold the door closed during the cycle to prevent water from leaking and it also incorporates the door latch switches that supply power to the dishwasher controls. If the door cannot close properly to activate the door latch switches or if the switches are defective, then the dishwasher controls will not receive power and the dishwasher will not start. Inspect the latch assembly including the switches.
How to test a dishwasher door latch assembly with a multimeter:

Disconnect your appliance from the power source before beginning.
Begin by removing the inner door panel to gain access to the door latch assembly. It is usually found at the top of the door. Once you have located it, verify that the door catch activates the door latch switches by inserting the catch into the assembly.
If the switches are being activated mechanically, remove the switches to check them for continuity. Using a multimeter on Rx1, touch the probes to the switch’s terminals. This should produce a reading of zero or nearly zero.
If you receive a different reading, you will need a replacement door latch assembly.

Timer Or Electronic Control


If you have determined that the door latch assembly is operating properly and your dishwasher still won’t start, the next step would be to look at the timer or electronic control. The first step of the dishwasher cycle is normally a drain function to remove any standing water in the tub. If you do not hear the drain pump motor running, then you should look at the timer or electronic control as a possible cause. On manual timer models, the timer is used to supply power to the pump motor, water inlet valve, heater circuit and drain pump motor at the proper sequence in the cycle. The timer uses a series of electrical contacts that are driven by a small motor all of which are encased in the timer housing.
How to test a dishwasher timer with a multimeter:

Disconnect your appliance from the power source.
Locate and remove the timer. It will most likely be found in the control panel, but it is also often found behind the lower kick plate.
Some timers may have multiple sets of contacts/wires, if this is true for your model, you will need to refer to your wiring diagram to determine which contacts to test.
Set your multimeter to Rx1000 and touch the contacts with the probes. Most functioning timers will fall in the range of 2000-3500 ohms of resistance, but this varies between models. Refer to your owner's manual to determine what reading your test should produce.
If your test results differ from the manufacturer's recommendations, you will need a replacement timer.

Check to ensure that the switch is properly depressed before attempting any disassembly. The contacts of the selector switch can be checked for continuity with a multimeter using the schematic diagram as a guide.
How to test a dishwasher selector switch with a multimeter:

Begin by disconnecting your appliance from the power source.
Remove the inner door panel of your dishwasher in order to locate the selector switch. It most likely will be found on the control panel. Once you have located it, ensure that the switch is properly depressed. If it is, remove it from the appliance in order to test it.

Piston & Nut Assembly


Some models of dishwashers utilize a check valve as part of the drain pump. Within the check valve, there is the piston and nut assembly. If your dishwasher is not draining water properly, the piston and nut assembly could be the source of the problem.
How to inspect a dishwasher piston & nut assembly:

Disconnect your appliance from the power source.
Locate your piston & nut assembly. It likely will be found on the bottom of the tub, beneath the sump cover.
 Inspect your piston & nut assembly to determine if it is functioning properly. The assembly should move up and down freely. When the piston is in the down position, it should form a tight seal. If it is not forming a complete seal, the dishwasher will not completely pump out the water.
If you find any issues while performing the inspection, you will need a replacement piston & nut assembly.

Drain Pump & Motor


All dishwashers will have a method to drain the water. Most models will have a single motor driven pump with two separate compartments, one for circulation and one for drain, each with its own impeller. Other types will have a separate drain pump, and some will utilize the main circulating pump in conjunction with a drain solenoid and diverter valve or flapper. On models that use a separate drain pump, you should check to see if there is any obstruction to the input and output of the pump and also verify that there is power getting to the pump motor during the drain portion of the cycle.
How to test a dishwasher pump with a multimeter:

Check Valve Flapper


Some dishwasher models will use a check valve in the drain outlet. The check valve is used to allow water to flow in one direction but will prevent the dirty water from re-entering the dishwasher. If you suspect that the drain hose has a restriction or if you find that wastewater is getting back into the dishwasher tub, then the check valve is most likely the problem.
How to inspect the check valve flapper in a dishwasher:

To ensure your safety, unplug your dishwasher before beginning this inspection.
Locate your check valve flapper in order to inspect it. In most models, it will be found on the outlet port of the drain pump or housing. You will need to remove the lower access panel in order to inspect it.
Visually inspect the flapper for any signs of wear or damage. You should also check to see if there is any dirt or debris preventing the flapper from moving freely, remove anything you may find.
If your valve is damaged, or if you find no objects preventing it from opening properly, you will need a replacement check valve flapper.
